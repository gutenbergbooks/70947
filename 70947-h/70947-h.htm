<hr class="r5">
<p>The sketch contained in this third volume concludes
the triptych of my ‘Months in Switzerland.’ The
first volume was issued in ’73, the second last spring.
A separate volume has been assigned to each sketch.
In the original forecast of the work it was anticipated
that sufficient range could not be given to it in less
than three such sketches. So far, then, as that goes
its design is completed.</p>

<p>My object has been to present a continuous picture
of the scene, endeavouring throughout to give to
its human element such prominence as the occasion
might admit. That has now been done for some
thousand miles. Of this continuous picture about
four hundred miles, these being chiefly in the Grisons,
are contained in the following pages.</p>

<p>In concluding the work I will ask my readers to
recall two conditions I propounded for their consideration
at its commencement, as imposed upon me by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
the nature of its subject, for, of course, the method
of treatment must always be that which the subject
makes appropriate. Of these the first is that fulness
and minuteness of detail are here, as in a <i lang="fr">tableau de
genre</i>, unavoidable and indispensable. The character
of the scenes and objects to be described, our familiarity
with them, and the nearness of our point of view
are the grounds of this necessity. Fulness and minuteness
of detail are, again, required for the sake of the
constantly implied comparison with home scenes, and
with home life, which underlies the whole narrative,
and is one of the sources of whatever interest it may
possess, just as it was at the time with the excursions
themselves. To this I will beg permission to add
what also I have said elsewhere, that in these volumes
it is a part of my aim so to take the reader along
with me as to enable him to reconstruct the excursions
in his own mind, almost as completely as if he had
himself been one of the party. I, therefore, give the
narrative of all that was seen, and of all that what
was seen brought into my mind, not only from day to
day, but almost from hour to hour. I should have
failed in this part of my aim, if the reader had come
to think that more had been seen than really was
seen, or that my opportunities were in any respect
greater than they really were, or that anything was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
grander, or more enjoyable, or in any way better,
than it really was. If I have succeeded by the
method I have followed in presenting a true picture,
and if some, whose judgment I am glad to find
favourable, think the picture worth looking at, then
this part of my purpose is answered. Truth in these
matters has a relative as well as an absolute element:
the latter, as it belongs to the objects themselves,
must needs be an unvarying factor, the former, as it is
coloured by the observing eye, cannot but be an ever-varying
reflection of times and persons. There are
many things we of this day do not see as those who
were before us saw them; and those who are to come
after us will not see them as we see them. Hence the
necessity that each generation should have on all subjects,
into which the varying element largely enters,
its own books; and this brings me to the second condition
of which I am desirous of reminding my readers,
which is that this work belongs to the category of
those in which the writer’s own impressions, feelings,
and opinions are really the main part of what he has,
properly, to offer to his readers. He is not engaged
in solving some impersonal problem of science, or in
discussing some question of history, or of criticism, as
impersonally as it may be possible to discuss such questions,
but in narrating how the natural scene, about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
which all will have their own ideas, and how what
he saw of everyday life, about which every one will
feel differently, impressed himself.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the following pages I have thought it worth
while again to invite attention to the industry, thrift,
helpfulness, and honesty of the Swiss peasant proprietors,
who are the basis and main stock of the
Swiss social system. Some study of them may be of
use to us, because we can in them trace up these solid
sterling elements of character to their source in the
educative power of property, especially of property in
land; and the perception of the effects in them of
this cause may lead us to inquire whether the character
of our own agricultural labourers would not be
raised, if they, too, were brought under the educative
influences of property. Probably nowhere in Europe,
it may be in the world, is the class that cultivates the
soil so destitute of property as in this country. He
amongst our agricultural labourers must be in an exceptionally
good position who owns, or ever will own,
anything except his clothes, and a few pounds’ worth
of old furniture. To be in this way cut off from all
hope of improving their condition in life, and from
the civilizing influences of property, and of the pursuit
of property, must, one cannot but think, have deteriorating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
effects on the class. Should what we see
elsewhere confirm us in this supposition, then we may
become disposed to inquire whether there are not in
this country some hindrances, as one cannot but
imagine there must be, to the acquisition of property
in land by our agricultural labourers; and whether
the removal of such hindrances, supposing them to
have been discovered, would not have a tendency to
engender in the minds of this long disinherited class
the idea of acquiring, and the desire to acquire, some
little property in land, and so to lead on to their
recovering the long-lost mental qualities necessary for
enabling them to live by the cultivation of small
holdings. In the note at the end of this volume I
have endeavoured to show how the loss of these
mental qualities was brought about in them.</p>

<p>I said in the first volume of this work, when
speaking of peasant properties, that in these days
both the man and the land can be turned to better
account. What I meant by this, as I there explained,
was that an able and energetic man has now opened
to him more promising careers than that of living by
the cultivation of three or four acres, and that these
same few acres also might possibly now be made to
yield a greater amount of produce if cultivated scientifically,
and with a liberal application of capital.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
This may be quite true; still, if things had their free
course, we might come to find that many of our agricultural
labourers were capable of recovering the qualifications
needed for this kind of life, which, if we may
judge from what we see in other countries, is the natural
desire and ambition of a peasantry; and, too, it may
be good for a nation so largely commercial and manufacturing
as ourselves to have so sturdy and stable a
class among the ingredients of its population.</p>

<p>And we may, perhaps, some day come to not dissimilar
conclusions with respect to the artizans of our
towns. Property, and the pursuit of property, may
be found to be a remedy for much that we regret to
see in them, and it may be proved to be possible by
moral and intellectual training—their wages being
already in very many cases sufficient for this purpose—to
qualify a fair proportion of them for attaining to
the possession of some little capital in money for investments
of one kind or another. This appears to
be the natural, and, if so, then the readiest and most
generally available means for calling forth, and
strengthening in them, as in all men, some very valuable
elements of character. To this extent, and it is
an extent that is far from inconsiderable, property,
and the efforts necessary for attaining it, may prove
in their case great humanizers. But for the initial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
desire to acquire property the starting point of a certain
moral and intellectual condition is necessary.
Roughs and wife-beaters have no thoughts about property.
And the vast sum that is year by year squandered
by our working classes on intoxicating drinks
demonstrates that, as the general rule, among them
the idea of property is dim and feeble. This, indeed,
may be regarded as almost the distinguishing characteristic
of the working classes of this country. Reading,
writing, and arithmetic will not of themselves
supply what is wanted. They supply tools, and some
materials; but tools and materials do not teach us
how to build. Training—moral and intellectual
training where what has to be built is a human life—will
be requisite still. With this to inspire and to
guide them their efforts to acquire and to retain property
may contribute much towards making them
good fathers of families, and useful citizens, by
creating in them habits of industry, forethought,
thrift, self-reliance, self-restraint, self-respect, and respect
for law and order.</p>

<p><i>July 29.</i>—My destination was the Grisons. I
wished to see something of the aspects of nature and
of the conditions of human life in that elevated region
of central Europe. I arrived at Interlaken in the evening.
It had been raining heavily all the afternoon. I
found people complaining that the weather had of late
been unusually cold and wet.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>July 30.</i>—Went to Meiringen to find a guide; or
rather, as the excursion I was contemplating would
not require a guide, one who might act as a light
porter, and at the same time be in some sort a
companion. On the recommendation of the manager<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
of the Reichenbach Hotel, an acquaintance of the two
last summers, to whom I had written requesting him
to secure for me a good and true man possessed of
these qualifications, I engaged Henri Leuthold, at a
salary of 7 francs a day, which was to be raised by
whatever amount I might think fair, when we had
reached Pontresina, where living is dear, and guides are
not fed and lodged by the hotel keepers, which is the
practice at Meiringen, and many other places. This
is a bad system, for, of course, the wine and bread and
cheese given to the guide on arrival, and the dinner
afterwards, are ultimately given by the traveller. It
would be better for all parties in all respects, as we
are now discovering at home, that all payments should
be direct, instead of roundabout, and that they
should be made in money only. Both the payers and
the paid will, then, be making their calculations in one
and the same denomination, and there will be no
room for misunderstandings. It rained more or less
all day.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>July 31.</i>—At 12 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the rain ceased, and I at
once started for Innertkirchen. Though so much rain
had fallen, no sooner had it cleared up than, thanks to
the natural underdrainage of the land which obtains
throughout the greater part of Switzerland, the surface
became clean and dry. In passing I looked into the
structure of the Kirchet, that I might ascertain to
what extent it is composed of old <i>moraine</i> rubbish and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
of rock <i lang="la">in situ</i>. As seen from the Innertkirchen side,
it is clear that whatever there may be of the former
can be only on its summit, for just below that you see
the undisturbed stratification of the latter. I also
looked at the existing deep and almost perpendicular-sided
channel of the Aare to the right of the Kirchet,
to judge whether it was due to a fissure of the
mountain, or to the cutting action of the stream. I
came to the conclusion that, though so deep and
perpendicular, there is no evidence of any action but
that of the latter cause. It is quite clear that the
channel in its lower part, and for some way above the
water, is entirely due to the recent erosion of the
stream. This being undoubtedly the case so far, we
have only to suppose that the cutting action of the
water, which is now going on before our eyes at the
bottom of the ravine, formerly in remote times had the
same effect. What is now being done at the bottom was
once being done at the top; and so throughout from
top to bottom. The stream did not acquire its rock-excavating
power recently. It would be illogical to
ask for some other agent, when we find one quite
adequate for the work that has been done, now doing
precisely similar work on the same spot. Work, too,
of a more or less similar kind, together with the
presence of the same agent, is seen in every ravine in
Switzerland. We may, therefore, be sufficiently
certain that the whole of this deep perpendicular-sided
channel was cut out by the existing stream.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
We need not postulate an earthquake, or rend the
mountain by any other means. On the face of the
ravine there are no ruggednesses and no projections,
excepting where pieces of rock have been thrown off
by the action of frost. You know that they have
been thrown off because the face of the rock is in these
places less weather-stained, or wholly unstained. Had
the ravine been a rent, there would probably, in whatever
way it had been caused, have been many projections,
and much inequality of surface. On the other
side, however, a question may be suggested at this spot.
The face of the mountain on the west side of the bed
of the old lake is cut down very precipitously. How
was this done? It could hardly have been the work
of running water, for it is continued from the top of
the mountain down to considerably below what was
the level of the old lake. This may be due somewhat
to glacier action, somewhat to the action of frost, and
somewhat to the wash of the lake as it was subsiding.
But whatever might have been the way in which this
was brought about, it does not affect the question of
the channel.</p>

<p>In the afternoon made a call on an old acquaintance
at Unter Urbach, one of the four villages in the old
lake bed, which form the commune of Innertkirchen.
I found him, though a porter, yet the proprietor of
nearly four acres of good prairie. This land had been
bought out of the savings of his earnings as porter.
First one acre was purchased. That first acre was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
great difficulty, for when it had been obtained, money
could be raised upon it to buy another piece. When
that been paid for partly by the good man’s earnings
and partly by the produce of the first piece, a third
piece could be looked out for, and so on up to the
whole of the four acres, every subsequent purchase
being more quickly cleared than its predecessors. I
heard the same story of another acquaintance I had
at Wrickel, the village in the north-west corner of the
old lake bed. Indeed this effort to acquire land is
the mainspring of the life of the peasants hereabouts.
It is what sets in motion their whole life. The better
sort of men are all making this effort, are all living
for this purpose. It is the root of their industry,
of their painstaking, frugal, saving lives. The opportunities
there are under the Swiss system to acquire
land give the land to those who deserve to have it.
The system acts as a winnowing process. It sifts out
the idle and profligate through the natural consequences
of their idleness and profligacy; and rewards
the thoughtful, the self-denying, and the hard-working
through the natural consequences of their thoughtfulness,
self-denial, and hard work. It is a self-acting
case of social, moral, and intellectual selection.</p>

<p>It was very pleasing to contemplate how in the
scene before me every little scrap of ground had been
turned to the best account. If a few square yards
could have been anywhere made or gained, the requisite
labour had not been grudged. For this purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
everything had been done which ingenuity
could have suggested, or hard work effected. We in
very many places are allowing the sea to gain from
us all it can. They gain from their lakes, and
streams, and mountains all they can. Here every
man’s heart is in the land; with us no man’s: not
the landlord’s, who may never have seen it, except
when he walked over it with his gun; not the
tenant’s, who regards it with the feelings of a passing
occupier; not the labourer’s, who thinks only of his
wages, and regards the land merely as the scene of
his daily toil. For the casual beholder, it has no
suggestions but those of a food-factory. That it
should be a food-factory is certainly the first and
most necessary use of the land, and we should be
glad to be assured that we were making the most of
it in this respect. It would, however, be more interesting,
and perhaps the better for us, if it had also
some moral suggestions to make to us. Here you see
that men are thinking of it when they are rising up,
and when they are lying down, and while they are
walking by the way, that it shapes their lives, that it
makes them what they are. These facts and considerations
are not a demonstration of the preferableness
of peasant proprietorship, but they are, I think,
a demonstration of one advantage, and that not an
inconsiderable one, that is secured by making the
land accessible to all, which it never can be while
each generation is permitted so to settle and charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
it as practically to take it out of the market of the
generation that will follow.</p>

<p>Having got through my visits I went with Leuthold
to see the valley of the Urbach. For this purpose
we ascended the western mountain, and having
reached what to us was the commencement, but in
nature the end, of the valley, we had the upland
village of Unterstock on the left. We advanced up
the valley for about an hour with grand mountain
scenery before us. Our object was not only to see
the character of the valley, and of its mountain
ranges, but also to look at its winter stabling for
cows, that I might know how they are lodged and
kept up here at that season. For this purpose we
went into several. As the stalls are very low, and
the cows closely packed, the temperature, whatever it
may be outside, can never be very severe within.
When the cows have been housed for the season, the
men who have charge of them come up from below
every evening to milk them. They sleep in the hayloft;
and having again milked them in the morning,
carry down the milk to the villages of Innertkirchen.
Should the weather prove bad, these men remain in
the high valley all day. To enable them to do this
whenever requisite, fuel, potatoes, and cheese are
stored in each byre. To the potatoes and cheese the
cows add milk. As this is the arrangement adopted,
it must, doubtless, be under existing circumstances
the best, though one would have supposed that these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
daily journeys for and with the milk must require far
more labour than would be necessary for bringing
down the hay. What decides the question may be
that labour is scarce and dear in summer, but abundant
and cheap in winter. If, however, the existing
mountain footpath could be made available for carts,
the cows would then probably be made in the autumn
to bring down themselves and their winter fodder.</p>

<p>I had had some reasons for looking forward to
the little excursion upon which I am now about to
enter, and so I dwell for a moment on these little
incidents of my first afternoon, as one does on the
first whiff of a cigar, or the first sip of a glass of wine.
He wishes to taste to the full, and to assure himself
of the good qualities of, what he had been for some
time anticipating. It would be disappointing if he
did not find, or imagine that he had found, the fruition
equal to the anticipation.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>August 1.</i>—Off at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> for Wasen by way of
the Susten. The books make it 26¹⁄₂ miles. This I
think somewhat beyond the true distance, though
two English ladies assured me—they were the only
English people I found at the hotel at Hof—that on
riding across it yesterday they had found it more
than fifty miles. It was a delightful walk, and offered
many elements of interest. As to the culture and
vegetation; they began with much variety. As we
ascended, the walnut trees were the first to disappear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
from the prairies and the roadside; then the plums
and apples. They were succeeded by the region of
conifers with its gradations; first the spruce, then the
larch, last of all the cembra. They in turn had to
make way for the treeless upland pastures. In a
Swiss valley the kind of trees around you, or the
absence of trees, indicate the height to which you
have ascended. They are a kind of natural hypsometer.
The thinning out of the villages, and
<i lang="fr">châlets</i>, and prairies keeps pace with the thinning out
of the species of trees. The Gadmenbach was never far
from the path. You often cross, or see on the opposite
side of the valley some blustering torrent, or some mere
thread of water, hastening to join it. Cliffs of naked
rock appeared at all elevations: sometimes protruded
in the valley bottom below you; sometimes
higher up on its sides; at all events generally on the
summits in sight. At times we had glimpses of
distant snowfields. The soil, which the industry of
many generations has accumulated and preserved on
the surface, is good on this, the Gadmen side of the
Pass, and so the predominant colour around us was
green of varying tints, generally the lively green of
the prairies; at this time at its liveliest, for the hay
had lately been carried, and the second growth was
again springing up, without bents and seed stalks.
There was enough in all this pleasantly to feed the
eye and the mind. With these objects before you,
you cannot but be kindly disposed towards every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
peasant you meet, for you see how hard he must be
toiling, as his fathers must have done before him, to
extort the means of living from the scene which is
giving you so much pleasure.</p>

<p>At the distance of an hour or two from Hof, a
stream—I was told that its name is Schwazbach—comes
tumbling down its rocky course from the
mountain on your left, and, rushing under a bridge
you cross, hurries on to join the Gadmenbach a little
below the bridge. It is composed, in American phrase,
of two forks, which unite themselves into a single
stream half-a-dozen yards above the bridge. At the
point of the rocky interposed peninsula grows a willow
of many branches, and no main trunk. The branches
form angles with the stream of all dimensions, some
being erect, while some were on that day only just
clear of the water. My attention was first attracted
by the little tree itself, which had managed to establish
itself in so conspicuous a situation, and one so likely
to have been undermined from either side. You have
done well, I thought, to hold on there so long. As I
looked at it I found that its branches were peopled
with a horde of some hundreds of large black caterpillars.
Each was two or three inches long. If my
boyish entomological recollections are not at fault, we
have not in England a willow-feeding species of this
kind. As I observed the colony, thinking that the
perpetual din and spray had done them no harm, I
noticed that all that were there were on the upper half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
of the tree. On the lower half the younger leaves of
every branch had been eaten off, some completely,
some partially, the oldest only being untouched, just
as was the case with the leaves of the branches of the
upper part of the tree; what, then, had become of
those who had eaten them? Down to a certain level
every twig had its residents; below that level not
one. It was evident that the lower twigs, too, had
lately been tenanted; but where were their late
tenants? They had not emigrated to the branches
immediately above the deserted ones, for those had
no more occupants than the topmost branches. Nor
would any enemy have cleared off in this regular
manner those on the lower branches, and neglected
those on the upper ones. There could, therefore, be
but one explanation. There had lately been two or
three days of continuous heavy rain. This must have
swollen our impetuous stream to an additional height
of three or four feet. Up to this height, then, the
lower branches had been submerged, and all that
dwelt upon them swept away; just as might have
been the case with the exposed portion of some
village of poor peasants, on which an avalanche had
fallen. Whether those who had lived in this exposed
quarter of the village had been better or worse
Christians than others would have had no effect in
turning aside, or in bringing down the avalanche, any
more than analogous considerations had to do, as we
are told, either with the fall, or with the effects of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
fall, of the tower of Siloam. With our caterpillars, at
all events, no theory of misdoings, or shortcomings, is
available. What, then, we call chance, or accident,
but which may be nothing of the kind—prevails
among caterpillars as well as among Christians. The
avalanche falls, and crushes half a village of Christians;
the stream rises, and drowns half a colony of sociable
caterpillars. There is, however, this difference between
the conditions of the two; the caterpillar not having
the power of anticipating and guarding against many
of the contingencies of its lot, will not, probably, die
of natural decay. Sooner or later, in the present, or
in the succeeding, stage of its existence, it will fall a
prey to some stronger insect, or to some bird or beast—these
went to feed the fish, or aquatic insects; but
the Christian has that faculty which made him a
Christian, and which enables him to foresee and provide
against most of the accidents and chances to
which he is exposed; and so he has, or should, have,
a fair chance of dying of natural decay. The mischief
is that he has not been taught to exercise this faculty
as much as he might, and ought; and that, therefore,
he is still liable to be carried off more frequently than
need be by polluted water, polluted air, overwork of
body, or of mind, overfeeding, and many other such,
not accidents, but preventible causes, among which
must be reckoned his having placed his dwelling on a
site exposed to avalanches, or floods, or malarious
exhalations. Perhaps the time will come when not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
to do all that we have been permitted to do in the
way of providing against the action of such causes
will be regarded as irreligious, as a tempting of Providence,
as a sinful neglect of the laws of God.</p>

<p>And so I walked on and on, and up and up,
pleasantly contemplating the objects of the scene
around, pleasantly spinning and weaving thought, and,
when tired of that, pleasantly talking to Leuthold. I
had already taken a liking to him. He was a clean-built,
well-featured man, with a gentle voice, and
gentle thoughts. His wife had for some time been in
feeble health, and this seemed to be making him still
more gentle and thoughtful. I now recall one of his
sayings; ‘If a man has health and strength for his
work, and is satisfied with his family, he has the best
riches.’ His trade was that of furniture-making, by
which he supported himself and his family during the
winter. Not much can be earned in this way at
Innertkirchen; and, therefore, and, too, because like
his neighbours he was investing in land all he could
save, he had to live hard. His fare during the long
winter was potatoes, milk, and coffee, with meat only
on Sundays. Of land, however, he had enough for
two cows. I was amused at his having brought with
him his ice-axe, for this would lead some of those we
met to credit me with the intention of essaying difficult
ascents, though I was not contemplating anything of
the kind. It, however, indicated that he was himself
ready for such undertakings. He confided to me his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
intention of purchasing on his return home some
English volume, and of endeavouring by its aid to
acquire a knowledge of the language. The following
question which, after a pause of some moments, he
put to me this morning will show that he had already
made a beginning in this study; ‘How many clocks
will you dine to-day?’</p>

<p>At last we reached the little inn of Stein, at the
foot of the great Stein glacier. We were here 6,122
feet above the sea, and about 1,300 below the Pass.
For some time all that was bright, and soft, and
humanly pleasing in the scene had been dying out.
On our left we had lost the lofty ridge of the Gadmen
Fluh, now screened by the Wendenhorn, behind
which, and so out of sight to us, it was rising into
the Titlis, its culminating point. On our right were
grand ravine-torn, and perpendicular-faced precipices.
At the little inn we found ourselves close upon the
glacier. As this mighty mass has been advancing
for the last thirty years, you will think that in the
arrangements of inexorable Nature the days of the
little inn are numbered; and so as you sit outside, in
the warm sunshine, a rock for your table and seat,
and the green turf for your footstool, with your bread
and cheese and wine before you, and with the herd
of kine, some quietly grazing around you, and some
lying down, and meditatively chewing the cud, you
will feel as if the vast icefield beside and above you
were some cold-blooded, remorseless, living monster,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
that is leisurely and irresistibly advancing in his own
fashion to spread himself over, and obliterate all
around you. The turf, however, and the little inn
will not be unavenged, for the sun, whose warmth
you are now feeling so delightful at this altitude, or a
diminution of pressure from the snowfields above, will
some day oblige the monster to recoil again to his
own proper domain of eternal cold and barrenness.</p>

<p>Having finished your bread and cheese, and
<i>chopine</i> of wine, and well sunned yourself, your
muscles will have recovered their tone, and you will
begin to make the last ascent along the side of the
northern mountain. The mighty monster is here a
little beneath you, on your right, as it were sleeping
with one of his feet resting against the mountain you
are passing along, the other being to the west of the
rocky eminence before you. His vast body and
shoulders are spread out for many an acre between
this eminence and the heights of the Sustenhörner
and Thierberg, on which reposes his snowy, shaggy
head. His hugeness, form, and position, make him
worthy of far more notice than he has as yet received.
The reason why so few go to see him is, I believe,
that the books overstate the walk that is required for
going. Of this, if taken from the west, an hour may
be struck off at its commencement by starting from
Hof instead of from Meiringen, which reduces it to
ten hours of not hard work even for a first walk, as I
found it this day. Or, if this be considered too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
much, it may be divided into two easy stages, by
sleeping at Stein; and who would not be glad to
sleep more than 6,000 feet above his usual level, and
at the foot of so grand a glacier?</p>

<p>Having reached the summit of the Pass, an entirely
different scene presents itself to your view.
The aspects and colouring, and whole character of
the Meienthal are almost the reverse of those of the
Gadmenthal. It is but thinly clad with turf, which,
too, is of sombre tints. There is none of the lively
green you have left behind you. The forest is a long
time in reappearing, and nowhere throughout do the
pines grow vigorously. Here on this side man has
to struggle more hardly to maintain himself. The
villages are fewer and further between. Wherever
you turn bleakness and barrenness are the predominant
suggestions. This gives you new effects, and by
simplifying the mountain masses, makes them appear
grander.</p>

<p>After three hours, or more, you see straight before
you a somewhat steep, half pine-clad ridge. You
advance towards it, and at somewhat over ten hours
from Hof, including your halt at Stein, you find
yourself at Wasen in the valley of Uri, on the road
to the <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Gothard, and that the mountain which had
lately been before you, and which is a fine termination
to your walk, is the western range of the Valley of Uri.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>August 2.</i>—Walked to Andermatt for breakfast.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
The building of the new hotels I noticed last year at
Göschenen, the northern entrance of the <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Gothard
tunnel, was going on as briskly as then. Of course,
before the railway is completed, there will be a post-road
across the Susten, and so that route will have
become a feeder to these hotels; and this new road
will itself be fed by another from the Valais over the
Grimsel, and through the Haslithal; and so there will
be a considerable stream of people who, from that
direction, will take the rail at Göschenen. There
will also be many who will for this purpose come to
the same point from the Grisons by way of Andermatt.
Possibly, therefore, they may not be building
too many hotels. At all events the tide of travellers
in Switzerland is still rising, and probably will continue
to rise, for we cannot at present imagine any
reason for its subsiding, or point to any instances in
which hotel building appears to have been overdone.</p>

<p>At Andermatt a telegram from his wife was
awaiting my good guide, to tell him that if he wished
ever again to see her alive, he must immediately
return home. As he showed it to me tears rose to
his eyes. Within five minutes of our arrival at
Andermatt he was on his way back to Hof. Poor
fellow! In his solitary walk home he would have
reason and opportunity enough for recalling what he
had yesterday said to me of the place domestic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
happiness occupied, in his estimation, among the constituents
of the true riches. Though he had been
with me only two days, I had already come to regard
him very favourably, and would have trusted him
farther than I could have seen him.</p>

<p>My first business now was to look for some one to
take Leuthold’s place. Among the candidates who
offered themselves I did not find one whose appearance
and style of talk suggested the probability of
his proving somewhat of a companion. I, therefore,
despatched a telegram to my wife, who was at
Portresina, to send me by to-morrow’s post a Poschiavo
man, of whom some weeks back I had heard that he
was desirous of acting as my porter. I was not unwilling
to try him, because he was one of the class—a
large and characteristic one in the Grisons—which
goes abroad to seek fortune. He had sought his for
ten years, but not with complete success, at the
antipodes; and now having returned, somewhat disappointed
at the result of his quest, was for the present
open to any engagement that required only unskilled
labour. Their own country being too poor to find them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
employment, temporary emigration, as most of us are
aware, is resorted to by a large proportion of the
youth of the Grisons. This is the national tradition. In
all the capitals of the old and new world these temporary
emigrants are found engaged in the production and
sale of pastry and confectionery, of loaf-sugar and
sugar-plums, of liqueurs and lemonade. My acquaintance
had endeavoured to amass the competency
on which he might return home, and which would
entitle him to a place among the aristocracy of
Poschiavo, by the concoction of lemonade and ices at
Sydney, and at several of the New South Wales
diggings. But what with fires, bad debts, and bad
building ventures at speculative diggings, which had
soon been deserted, he had not met with the success
which generally crowns Grison ambition; and so it
had come about that he was now maintaining himself,
as chance enabled him, till he might recover heart for
a new effort. Having despatched the telegram for
him to meet me to-morrow evening at Coire, I went
on in the afternoon by diligence to Dissentis.</p>

<p>As we slowly ascended the zigzags which carry
the road through the carefully kept prairies immediately
above Andermatt, the picture presented to
us was full of interest to an English eye. I went over
this ground in my ‘Month in Switzerland’ of last
year, and in my narrative of the scenes and incidents
of that excursion I said something of the history of
the Oberalp alpe which we are now entering on, and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
the various ways in which it is at present turned to account.
I now again read the scene with undiminished
interest. It was thoroughly Swiss. The mountain side
was so steep that skilful engineering had been required
to construct the road. With the exception of two or
three small patches of potatoes on the lower part,
nothing but grass could be grown. But how carefully
had the grass been cultivated! Though on the
mountain flanks, which must originally have been
strewn with stones and rocks, not a stone was
to be seen, and only a few protruding rocks
remained, which were so large as to defy removal.
Nowhere was there a noxious weed, or a bush. The
smooth emerald-green felt of turf was spread out everywhere,
frowned upon by overhanging craggy summits,
whose work of centuries had now been all undone; or
rather what was obstructive in that work had been
undone, and what might be made serviceable had
been turned to account. The showers of stones they
had been sending down through all those long ages
to bury the little soil they had helped to form, had
by the labour of successive generations of peasant
proprietors been all removed. There was nothing now
that could obstruct the stroke of the scythe, or the possible
growth of a blade of grass. Some of the summits
were still streaked and patched with snow, which suggested
that the frost, which rends the rocks, was up
there seldom idle. Along the grassy slopes were no
walls or hedges. Only where a boundary mark might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
be required, a stake had been driven into the ground.
These rose but a few inches above the surface. Here
and there might be seen a hay grange; but not many
of them, for in the winter the people hereabouts are
all collected into the little town. This, from the first
rise, shows as a cluster of sombre gray houses,
amongst which two churches stand pre-eminent. The
season was late this year, and so on the grassy slopes,
some of them very steep, were to be seen busily employed
in spreading, or in collecting the hay several
women. They were unshod, for here people are too
chary of whatever costs money, to wear shoes when
they can do without them. On their heads they had
orange kerchiefs. The men at this season are most
of them dispersed far and wide in their different
summer employments, by which they will earn a great
part of what will support their families in the long
winter; and so the haymaking devolves in some
places almost entirely on the women. To-day as they
stirred it about they made the air fragrant with its
scent, that air, which around us was so purely translucent,
but which above our heads seemed to solidify
into a firmament of indigo.</p>

<p>The effect of the scene upon you is enhanced by
the sense of your being so many thousand feet above
your ordinary level. You are, however, still going up,
and the mown sward is shrinking into Alpine pasture.
The haymakers now at a distance below show like
pigmies. The little town is now no longer sombre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
gray, but has in the sunlight, and by the distance,
become gleaming white.</p>

<p>As we approached the lake on the summit of the
Pass we saw that much turf had lately been cut for
the long cold winter. Up here nature gives no wood
for fuel. Fortunately, however, the climate is not unfavourable
to the growth of plants that in suitable
situations produce peat; though there is considerable
difficulty in drying the peat sufficiently to render it
combustible. To effect this we found it set up on
rocks, or, where these could not be found, on inclined
banks from which the rain would quickly run off. I
was sorry to see that there was much soil and sand
in this peat, and that, therefore, it was not of the best
kind for producing heat. Still it is the only fuel the
locality supplies; and without it, such even as it is,
fewer people could live at Andermatt, because in that
case the cost of a prime necessary of life would be
much increased.</p>

<p>At the head of the lake you are on the top of the
Pass, and enter the Grisons. At first, for some
distance, you descend rapidly; and may think, as you
often have occasion to think on Alpine roads, and, too,
with far more reason than here, that the traveller has
some need of faith in the skill of the driver, in the
excellence of the materials of the carriage and harness,
and in the training and sure-footedness of the horses.
For some time the road is down rather poor Alpine
pastures, meagre, steep, and rocky: but as we are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
looking at the scene with the eye of a Lincolnshire
grazier, we are glad to think that these meagre-looking
steep and rocky pastures will supply many a family
with good milk and cheese, a part of the latter being
convertible into such of the necessaries of their humble
lives as they cannot produce themselves. And are
there not grand mountain summits around you? And
is not the valley before you the cradle of the famous
Rhine? And are not all these mountains sending
down affluents to the already vigorous infant? These
are the thoughts with which you begin the descent.</p>

<p>You continue the descent, and in due time come to
the first village. You then understand more fully than
before the value of the meagre-looking, steep, and
rocky pastures. In the way of cultivated human food
nothing even here can be attempted but potatoes.
For anything else it is still too high, cold, and wet;
and the few potatoes will at the best be very poor,
small, watery, immature; and a frost may at any time
prevent their reaching even these degrees of all
but worthlessness. There must, however, be a beginning,
and these industrious people are not slow in
making it. A little lower down you come upon
attempts at cultivating in sheltered places with good
aspects rye and barley. It is now August, but here
the rye and barley are not yet in bloom. They are
still green and growing; the ear, however, has just got
out of the stem: that is as yet all. If these crops
should ever get so far as to be worth harvesting, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
see lofty frames, like monster clothes-horses, with
many bars, upon which the sheaves will be fastened
to improve the poor peasants’ chances of drying and
hardening the grain sufficiently for grinding. You will
see, too, that these growers of rye and barley under
difficulties are now busy in attempting to make hay
under similar difficulties, and in a similar fashion.
The mown grass is not spread out on the ground to
dry; that would be too wet for such a purpose; but
it also is arranged on frames, only of a different construction.
Each is formed of a post rising about five
feet above the ground, through which are passed two
or three bars at right angles to each other. Each bar
has two arms, and each arm projects from the post
about three feet. On these arms the hay is loaded
into a kind of cock, which has this arrangement of
the post and bars for an internal skeleton. It is thus
lifted off the damp ground, and is so held up throughout
by the bars, or arms, as to be completely pervious
to the air. In this way it is made in a ventilated
cock; and when a fine day comes, the women come,
and carry it home in large hempen sheets, and with
joyful and thankful hearts: for are they not carrying
home what will give their little ones milk in the long
winter? And up here their little ones could not live
without that milk.</p>

<p>As you approach Dissentis you see not only that
the breadth of cultivable land has much increased,
but also that you have descended into a more genial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
stratum of climate. Wheat, and even millet, have
put in an appearance on the scene. Here, in favoured
situations, I found the former so advanced that it
seemed to be beginning to show symptoms of a disposition
to change colour.</p>

<p>As two or three hours of daylight still remained I
walked down the banks of the stream that descends
from the Acletta valley, that I might see its junction
with the Rhine, for here the Rhine, of course, occupies
a prominent place in one’s thoughts, for has it
not a prominent place in the history of the Roman,
the French, and the German Empires, and in the
history, too, of the greatest captain of each—the great
Julius, the great Napoleon, and the great Moltke?
Behind it, as a natural and national bulwark, and on
its banks, the German people from the beginning of
their known national existence, were growing to
maturity, and organizing themselves. If the history
of the white race be regarded as a whole, this Rhine
stands out as the most historic of all its rivers. Much
has directly resulted from its being what it is, and
where it is. Its absence would have so modified the
history of the race as to have brought about a
state of things widely different from that of to-day.
The stream I was now tracking down to it—one of
the first threads from which, as it were from so many
roving machines, its first strand is spun—has below
the town cut out for about a mile or less a deep
ravine bed, along the rocky channel of which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
tumbles, and twists itself, in its haste to incorporate
itself with the nascent trunk of the famous river. It
seemed by its bluster and haste to be emphasizing its
desire to become a part of it, and a participant in its
renown. The actual junction was achieved a little
beyond the ravine, in a more quiet style. The impetuous
affluent is now no longer in a hurry, but will
taste to the full the contentment of the consummation
of the hitherto so eagerly sought union. At this
point were several trout-fishers. Up then almost to
its source this famous stream is rich in fish. Its
banks will soon be rich with vineyards.</p>

<p>As I had loitered for some time on the banks of
the young Rhine, and of its affluent, the evening was
closing in when I returned to Dissentis. As I passed
up the main street I overtook the female swineherd of
the place bringing home for the night the pigs of
Dissentis. There were four or five score of them.
She herself brought up the procession that none might
loiter behind. She had been tending them all day in
the ravine just mentioned, which was incapable of
cultivation, and on some stony irreclaimable waste
land on the Rhine bank. Each porker knew his own
home in the town. Some ran on in advance of the
herd to get as soon as possible to the supper they knew
would be ready for them. Some did not separate
themselves from the herd till they had arrived at the
familiar door. These more quiet-minded members of
the herd probably had no expectation of a supper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
prepared for them, and were, therefore, still thinking
of the grassy pasture from which they had just been
driven off. The swine were followed, at no great interval,
by the goats with stiffly distended udders.
They, too, dispersed themselves in the same fashion,
from the desire to be promptly relieved of their
burden. After the goats, last of all, came the deliberately
stepping, sober-minded cows. The tinkling of
their bells was heard over the whole of the little
town. In a few minutes the streets were cleared:
every man, woman, and child appeared to have followed
the animals into the houses to give them their
supper, or to draw the milk from them, as the case
might be; or at all events to bed them for the night.
Thus do these hard-pressed peasants from their
earliest years learn to treat their dumb associates
kindly, almost as if they were members of the family,
to the support of which they so largely contribute.
There can be few people in Dissentis who do not
begin, and end, each day in company with them.
How familiar must they be with the ways and the
wants of the egoistic pig, of the self-asserting, restless
goat, and of the gentle, patient cow! The book of
nature, too, is always open before them, and they are
ever interested students of its pages. From hour to
hour they observe the changes of the heavens, and
consider what they import, for to them they import a
great deal. How their little crops, too, are looking
they note day by day, for the time that will be allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
for bringing them to maturity will be so short, that the
loss of sunshine for a few days causes some anxious
thoughts. This dependence upon, and close contact
with, nature is a large ingredient in their education.</p>

<p><i>August 3.</i>—Opposite to my hotel was the public
fountain of Dissentis. The functions of a Swiss
fountain resemble those of an Eastern well. To it
come daily all the women of the village for the water
they will require for their families. It has, however,
other uses besides that of supplying the water that
will be needed within the house. The linen, the milk
vessels, and the cooking utensils of the village are for
the most part washed at the fountain, for it would be
hard work to carry home all the water that might be
wanted for these purposes. Here, too, the daily news
of the village is discussed, and put into circulation.
This morning there was a stranger seated on the
bench in front of the Hotel de la Poste, observing
those who came to the Dissentis fountain. As to their
personal appearance, it was evident that the hard
work and poor fare of many generations had not
dwarfed the race, for those who came were generally
above what we should regard as the middle height.
Their features, however, as might have been expected,
were somewhat hard. Their dress was sombre: they
are not a people who much affect colour. Their
<i>coiffure</i> was simple: upon it not much time or care
had been bestowed. Their <i>chaussure</i> at this early
hour was with most of them that of nature. In their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
manner there was not much of liveliness, not, I suppose,
because that would have been deemed unbecoming in
public, but probably because they might not have
been disposed to it. The hardness of their lives must
bring with it some hardness of manner. These good
women had already been up some hours, milking the
cows and goats, and providing their husbands’ and
children’s breakfasts; and this might have taken out of
them some of that freshness of feeling that would have
been in keeping with the freshness of the morning.
They might, too, have been desirous of getting as
quickly as possible to the hay-field, and the prospect of
the hard work there awaiting them might have had
something to do with making them grave and taciturn.</p>

<p>The telegraph bureau is on the ground floor of
the hotel. Here the instrument, as is generally the
case in Switzerland, was in charge of a young woman.
What would the last generation in the valley, or the
abbots and monks of their forefathers’ time, have
thought of a young woman of Dissentis earning her
livelihood by keeping Dissentis in instantaneous
communication with all Europe, the new world, and
the antipodes? When the locomotive and marine
engine were invented man began to move to and fro
upon the earth. This movement, however, is still
only at its beginning. When the electric telegraph
was invented all the world was enabled to converse
with all the world. This conversation, too, is still
only at its beginning. And yet it is to these two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
agencies that we must attribute the rapidity with which
events march in these times. But as this rapidity is
so great at the beginning what are we to suppose that
it will be a century hence? This is what no man can
imagine. The astounding character of the last war in
Europe was due to the railway and the telegraph.
Whatever at this moment most engrosses attention,
and agitates thought, as for instance the organization
of the working classes, the rapid combined action of
the leaders of aggressive Ultramontanism, and even
the recent development in ‘leaps and bounds’ of the
commerce of the world, are mainly due to the same
causes. And if one of these causes is more potent
than the other, it is that all the world can now converse
with all the world, because it is this that in these days
enables for any purpose a whole kingdom, a whole
continent, or the whole world, to organize itself. We
may compare the rapidity with which these inventions
have been turned to account with the snail’s pace at
which letters, the most fruitful of all human inventions,
have been manifesting their powers and uses. For how
many thousands of years have they been working for
the overthrow of ignorance, superstition, and injustice!
It is true that in this work mighty advances have been
made: yet when we survey the whole field we see
that hitherto only so much has been done as to give
assurance that a great deal more will be achieved in
the future. What has been accomplished gives us
ground for the hope that it is but a glimpse of what is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
to come. They have done, or at all events have
rendered possible the doing of, almost all that has
been done for us. What we notice is that it seems to
have been done so slowly. Perhaps the electric telegraph
by collecting and disseminating intelligence,
and enabling people everywhere to converse with each
other, is destined to lighten this reproach of letters,
that they have not been so rapidly or widely fruitful
as might have been expected.</p>

<p>At Dissentis the magician who manipulated this
instrument of instantaneous communication with all
the world, was a little body, very little, with very
gentle voice and manner. By the side of the instrument
she was working had been placed a bouquet of
flowers, white marguerites, and red geraniums, with a
carnation or two—a flower you see everywhere in
Switzerland, generally in a pot, or box at the <i lang="fr">châlet</i>
window, for the Swiss are as fond of it, and tend it as
lovingly, as the modern Greeks. These flowers much
brightened the aspect of things, and took off from
their office look. On my asking for a <i>billet</i> for the
10.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> diligence for Coire, the little body filled it
in, and handed it to me made out in my proper name.
The traveller, presuming on a previous conversation,
commented upon this. ‘Now I see that you are in
every respect a little Fairy. You know everything.’</p>

<p><i>Little Fairy.</i> ‘It is that in these days little Fairies
must learn to read, and yesterday evening your <i>sac</i>
was left for some time in my bureau.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p><i>Traveller.</i> ‘Yes. But in learning to read letters
they have not forgotten their old skill in reading what
is meant by a present of flowers.’</p>

<p><i>Little Fairy.</i> ‘Flowers fade, and so sometimes
does their meaning.’</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the road to the hotel
<i lang="fr">Condrau de la Poste</i>, is, to the left of the fountain, the
hotel <i lang="fr">Condrau de la Couronne</i>. The latter Condrau
is the editor of the Romansch newspaper which is
published at Dissentis. I was told that he was a
well-educated man, had for some time been tutor in a
French family, and was entitled to write himself
Professor. I took away with me a copy of that week’s
impression of his paper. I found that it was not
difficult by the aid of Latin and Italian to make out
the meaning of the printed Romansch of Dissentis,
though probably, if I had heard it read, I should not
have understood one word in ten.</p>

<p>At 10.30 was under weigh for Coire. The day
was fine, and the conductor arranged a seat for me on
the roof upon the luggage. The drive was pleasant
and interesting. I can, however, only give of it such
generalities as might have been seen from my seat on
the roof. Of course the mountains most obtrude
themselves on the eye. They vary much. Some are
grassed, some are wooded to the top; some show
much naked rock; of these some terminate in jagged
points, some in rounded domes; some that you see
through gaps in the bounding ridges gleam with sun-lit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
snowfields. As a rule the valley is wide, and so its
bounding ranges stand back to such a distance that
they can be well taken in by the eye from bottom to
top, and in combination with their neighbours. They
can be leisurely and sufficiently seen.</p>

<p>Another point observable in this grand long valley
is the regular improvement in the vegetation which
accompanies your descent. This has been already
noted as far as Dissentis. In reaching that place
yesterday afternoon we had passed from the treeless
Alpine zone of altitude down to that of late maturing
wheat. When you reach Coire, thirty-eight miles
lower down, wheat has been superseded by maize, and
you are among vineyards, which had begun to show
themselves seven miles higher up at Reichenau.
Between Dissentis and Reichenau different kinds of
fruit trees, and of garden vegetables successively appeared
on the scene. As the fruit trees began to
come in, the frames for drying wheat, and other kinds
of grain, began to die out. Above Reichenau are
some naked glaring ravines cut deep into the white
calcareous soil. Here the bottom land has so widened
out as to give space for knolls and hills, some in wood,
some in grass. As you descend an improvement,
corresponding to that in the vegetation, is simultaneously
observable in the houses and villages. As
nature becomes more kindly and bountiful, human
life becomes more varied, more easy, and more embellished.
Long before you reach Reichenau good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
roomy substantial houses begin to appear in the small
towns. Many of these are surrounded with gardens,
of which you see nothing in the higher part of the
valley, but which after they have become possible
continue to improve all the way down. At last at
Coire there is about the main street an air of something
that gives it a not quite unfamiliar aspect. It
seems as if a third-rate piece of Paris had been transported
to the valley, and there dropped between the
mountains.</p>

<p>At Coire, if you have some time before you, and
nothing else to do, you will perhaps go to the Cathedral.
You will there hear the old story of Saints and
wonders, as if there had been better men and greater
wonders a thousand years ago than there are now.
Here the Saint was a British king, of a date when
there were no kings in Britain. You will have met
with British and Irish Saints elsewhere. You ask
why these legends of British and Irish Saints of
that day, but no Saints now? Have we degenerated
so much from our fathers? I trow not. We are not
worse than were they. We may, perhaps, be somewhat
better. How, then, has it come to pass that
these islands have ceased to be a factory of Saints?
Is it because other people have at last come to know
us? No longer are we so separated from them by
the sea as to be in their eyes almost another world;
and as they have come to know us they have arrived
at the discovery that we are very much like themselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
at all events in not being more productive of
Saints than themselves. In those times people
wanted the idea of a nation of Saints. This they
could not imagine of their wicked selves, or of any of
their still more wicked neighbours, for they very well
knew of themselves and of their neighbours, that they
were always trying to overreach, and plunder, and
knock on the head, and oppress each other; and so
they localized this idea beyond sea, and the British
Isles became a kind of realized Christian Atlantis.
Tacitus, because the Romans were vicious, invested
the distant Germans with a halo of rude virtues. For
much the same kind of reason did the ages of ignorance
and violence go to the British Isles for so many
of their Saints.</p>

<p><i>August 4.</i>—My Grison circumnavigator—for he
had gone to Sydney by the Cape, and returned by the
Horn—had been due at Coire last night at 9.30. A
violent storm, however, on the Albula, and which had
extended to Coire, had delayed the post till past
midnight, and so I had gone to bed before his arrival.
At 6 o’clock this morning he introduced himself to
me. The first impression was not quite what he
intended it to be. His general get-up was elaborate,
and far in advance of mine. Everything upon him
was new, from his stylish billycock hat, which afterwards
he told me he had bought in Paris, to his boots
which were fitter for the carpet than for the road.
His outer apparel was of good broadcloth. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
umbrella was of silk. As I was noting these particulars
at the first glance, he improved their effect
by telling me that he considered the 10 francs a day,
for which he had agreed to carry my <i>sac</i>, insufficient.
This I at once cut short by assuring him that I was
of a different opinion; and that, if he had any intention
of accompanying me, he must be ready to start
for the Strela as soon as it ceased to rain. At 10.30
the sun burst through the previously unbroken
canopy of dripping cloud, which withdrew with a
magical rapidity that made one wonder what had
become of it, and where it had gone. There was no
corresponding promptitude in the appearance of the
circumnavigator, for the sun had been shining half an
hour when he again presented himself at my hotel
(I had not seen him since the interview at 6 o’clock),
and with overdone complaints of the cost of his
breakfast, and with a bad grace, having taken my
<i>sac</i> in one hand, his silk umbrella being in the other,
we were off.</p>

<p>It is a good practical rule to be prepared for the
worst, without at all taking it for granted that it will
come to that, for things need seldom turn out as bad
as they may be made to look, or as they may be
forced into becoming. So I began by assuming that
all was just as it should be, and would so continue.
Our road was at first up hill, and the sun was full on
our side of the valley. This, and the moisture with
which the air was laden, for the wet on the surface of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
the ground, and on every dripping object, was being
rapidly evaporated, made it unusually warm walking.
I foresaw the good effect this might have, for I anticipated
that it would bring my circumnavigator to a
consciousness of his unfitness for his work, and so
probably would lead him to correct the estimate he
had lately been setting forth of the value of his prospective
services. What I had anticipated was not
long in coming. He soon had to take off his broadcloth
coat. Within an hour he called a halt. Before
the second hour was out his boots had become so
pinching and galling that he had begun to limp. He
never again was so beaten as on this day; indeed,
he continued to improve during the whole of the time
he remained with me, though to the last he was far
from having acquired the power of doing well an
ordinary day’s work; and this often obliged me, as it
did to-day, to end the day’s march short of the point
to which I should have been glad to have extended
it; but from this time nothing more was heard of
his having underrated the value of his services.</p>

<p>From Coire to the Strela my road this day lay
along the Schanfiggthal. As to the road itself it was
still in process of construction. The first moiety had
for some time been completed, but not much used, as
was evident from the metal not yet having been compacted
together. Here the construction had been
easy. The latter moiety was in a very incomplete
state, for here the difficulties in the way of constructing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
a road had been great; and, as we saw to-day,
there will be still greater difficulties in the way of its
maintenance. The heavy rains of last night, and of the
foregoing week, had made this manifest to the contractors,
for in some places, where the new road had
been merely gouged out of the flank of the mountain,
it had been entirely swept away; and this had been
so done that it would be far more difficult to replace
it than it had been to form it in the first instance.
The mountain side is here composed of small incoherent
slaty <i>débris</i>, inclined at the greatest angle at
which such materials, when aided by the turf and
forest upon them, are capable of withstanding the
wash of the rain torrents. In forming the road the
turf, or forest, had been cut through, and the angle
above and below the road enlarged. Both the angle,
therefore, and the retaining conditions had been made
less favourable. Of this it was a necessary consequence
that when the rain torrent came down it
should in many places cut through the road, as it
would through so much sand; indeed more easily, for
the small incoherent slaty <i>débris</i> is more pervious to
water; and should leave incipient ravines sometimes
across, sometimes even in the direction of the road.
In some places, too, where the road had been built
up, the substructions had been swept away. All this
which was disastrous to the contractors was not without
some interest for those who now had to pass over
it, for it presented good opportunities for observing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
nature of the soil, and the action of running water upon
it, and so made clear what it was that gave to the valley
its peculiar character. On a long new slope where
the road, in consequence of the removal of the turf, had
been completely carried away, and the whole mountain
side set in motion, I had to find my way across the
steep, loose <i>débris</i>, where if I had stumbled upon it,
or it had slipped beneath my weight, I should probably
have rolled down many hundred feet to the
valley below. Again in a ravine, where a bridge was
to be built, the late flood had so cut away the further
side as to leave a perpendicular face of some twenty
feet in height. From the left corner of the bottom
of this to the right corner of the top I had to walk up
a diagonal ledge, nowhere wider than the width of the
foot, this being all that the workmen had for the
present thought it necessary to make for themselves.
If I had slipped from this ledge, or if it had given
way under me, I should have fallen on the rocks of
the torrent: of its giving way, however, I had no fear,
for I saw that some of the workmen must have tried
it with two or three more stones weight than I had to
place upon it. Of this road one may say further that
not only will it be very costly to maintain, but that the
population of the valley is so small, that if it is not
carried over the Strela to the Davosthal, it can never
be much used. We may, however, be sure that if
maintained as far as Langwies, to which point it will
soon be completed, it will not be allowed permanently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
to terminate there; for the Swiss are very wisely, and
with much skill and cost, rapidly opening up to the
traveller every valley that can be taken in hand by
the engineer. This is one of the conditions of the
continued growth of their prosperity. Every valley
that is opened soon has its hotels; and the increase of
travellers the hotels attract, and the concomitant increase
in the value of the land of the valley, before long
many times recoup the cost of the road. No people
understand so distinctly as the Swiss that to improve
means of communication, whether footpaths, post
roads, or railways, is to improve the most indispensable
of the material conditions of progress.</p>

<p>And now a word about the Schanfiggthal itself.
If not unique in its character, still it exhibits so
interestingly the characteristics of the class of valleys
to which it belongs as to make it well worth a visit.
What you first notice is that the new road, it was so
with the old horse path, is always at a great height,
perhaps never less than 1,000 feet, above the bottom
of the valley. A little observation soon reveals why
you have here, and must have, a high-level road. The
valley is formed on each side by a long precipitous
<i>talus</i> of the loose <i>débris</i> already mentioned. These
slant from their respective ridges down to the channel
of the Plessur, in which they meet. The question
then arises, Why is not the road here, as in other
valleys, on the banks of the stream? The answer is
that it is impossible to carry it along the bottom, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
anywhere near the bottom, because every small
affluent, or torrent, that descends from the lofty
ridges on the north or south side, has cut in its rapid
course down to the Plessur a deep ravine. Some of
these ravines are of an extraordinary depth, and they
all become wider and deeper the nearer they approach
to the bottom. A road, therefore, is only possible at
such a height as will enable it to turn, or cross, these
ravines, where they have not yet become of an impracticable
depth and width, and where it will not be
liable to be carried away every spring, or at any time
by any storm that may occur even at midsummer.
Hence the necessity of the high-level road. That it
is something peculiar is forced on your attention by
the scenery throughout the valley being presented to
you from an unusual point of view. The Plessur is
generally quite out of sight and hearing. You are
always looking down slopes of prairie or forest, which
are seldom open to the bottom. And the point blank
of the opposite ridge is always its middle height. All
this is new to you; and will give in your memory a
character of its own to the green, well wooded, ravine-seamed
Schanfiggthal.</p>

<p>Another particular of interest the Schanfiggthal
supplies is an instance of what geologists call earth-pillars.
Some of these I saw by the wayside in the
last ravine before entering Castiel, or <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s, I
forget which: the locality, however, may be so described
as to be readily identified. They are to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
seen from the new road about 200 yards beyond the
chief ravine it crosses in its whole course. It had
just made a bend to the left to cross this ravine, and
then had faced to the south to recover the line of its
general eastward direction. Just before it resumes
this direction, that is to say just as it is about to leave
the left side of the ravine, there are visible, some way
below you, on the opposite side of the ravine, several
of these earth pillars. Some appeared thirty feet, or
more, in height. Some had still on their tops the
boulders which had led to their formation. Of course
they are situated so high above the torrent of the
ravine as to be quite out of its reach, even at the
times of its greatest rise; for had it ever touched
them it must have undermined and washed them away.
Obviously their formation is due exclusively to the
action of rain. It must commence the work on the side
of a ravine, above high torrent mark, by washing away
the soil around a boulder. A beginning having thus
been made, the storms of centuries continue the
work; the water of every rainfall runs off the
boulder, and cuts down a little deeper into the soil
beneath, carrying down into the torrent below what
has been cut away. This action does not cut down
the soil beneath the boulder-cap quite perpendicularly,
so that as the height of the pillar increases,
or rather as the soil is more cut into, the base of the
pillar becomes somewhat enlarged. Its form, therefore,
is that of an exceedingly steep-sided cone. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
interest of these earth pillars is not confined to the
fact that they are a result of so long a continuance of
rain action, for as we look at them we cannot but be
reminded of some other conditions that were requisite
for their formation, such as suitableness of situation,
and soil of the requisite texture. Other instances of
the formation are to be found in Switzerland elsewhere,
and there may be some others even in this
valley; I believe, however, that nowhere in Europe
is it exhibited on so large a scale, and with such lofty
and perfectly formed specimens as in the Tyrol, in
the neighbourhood of Botzen.</p>

<p>To one coming from Coire the first village of the
Schanfiggthal is Maladers. The maps letter the
name conspicuously to indicate the importance of the
place. We, however, passed through it, or by it,
without seeing a house. We now, in the afternoon,
passed through Peist from end to end without seeing
a soul. It was now the height of the busy season, and
all the people were up or down the mountain making
hay, and the shutters of all the houses were closed.
As to the little inn, or <i lang="fr">châlet</i> which occasionally does
duty for one, it, as is frequently the case in the
Grisons, had no name or sign; and so we had looked at
it, as at the other houses of the place, without observing
in it any indications of likelihood for the discharge
of this function. At last an old woman, who
had heard our shouts, put her head out of an upper
window, and gave us the information we needed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
This unobtrusive inn was on the old road parallel to,
and a few paces below, the new road. We were admitted
by a young woman who had been left in
charge of the house. The room into which she
showed us was small, low, and square, with two very
small square windows in the Grison, that is to say
the embrasure, style. The little light they might
have admitted was lessened by the favourite branching
carnation, and a plant of ivy, in pots. Our first
question was what could she give us to eat? Her
reply was, ‘meagre cheese and dried beef.’</p>

<p>‘Of course you have milk.’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘Can you get some?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps.’ For she knew of a neighbour who
might have a cow at home in the village. All the rest
were on the alpe.</p>

<p>In about half an hour the meagre cheese, dried
beef, and milk were set before us, for I saw that in
such a house it would be better that I should invite
the circumnavigator to take his meals with me: it
would be soothing to his Australian sense of the
dignity of man, and would save trouble to the good
people. I afterwards came to a similar conclusion
with respect to the second bed in my bedroom, for I
could not suppose that there was any other room in
the house available for guests to sleep in.</p>

<p>As to the meagre cheese, and dried beef, during
the following three weeks, as must be the case with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
every pedestrian through the by ways of the Grisons, I
had many opportunities of weighing their merits and
demerits, undisturbed by any simultaneous consideration
of other comestibles. The meagre cheese is
made of skimmed milk in places where a market can
be found for butter. Peist sells its butter at Coire;
and so the good people of the place, and their few
visitors, have to content themselves with cheese
from which the butter has been extracted. It is not
positively bad; but this negation of badness is its
only merit. The dried beef is a production of the
Grisons, for which they are indebted to their climate.
At the altitude of their valleys, the air is so dry that
for nine months out of the twelve meat has no tendency
to decomposition. Availing themselves of this
favourable condition they kill in the autumn the beef
and pork they will require in the ensuing year. It is
slightly salted and hung up to dry. Nothing more is
done to it, except eating it. In three or four months
time it is not only dried, but also cooked, that is to
say the air has given it all the cooking it will ever
receive. It has become as dry and hard as a board,
and internally of the colour of an old mahogany table.
Externally there is nothing to suggest the idea of
meat; it is covered with cobwebs, dust and mould,
and is undistinguishable from fragments of the
mummies of the sacred bulls taken from the catacombs
of the Serapeum at Memphis. When your
host brings from his cellar the leg of the mummy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
a Grison cow, shrunk to the dimensions of the human
limb, and tells you that it is to be your dinner, you
are disposed to advise him to take it to the trustees
of the British Museum. He is, however, about to
prepare some for your repast, and you watch the
process with curiosity. It is a very simple one: the
material is cut across the grain with a very sharp
knife in shavings no thicker than writing-paper.
Were it cut the length of the fibre it would be as unmanageable
in the mouth as a piece of whipcord, or a
fiddle-string. Curiosity again, somewhat stimulated
by necessity, for the only alternative is the meagre
cheese, at last impels you, with many misgivings, and
after much deliberation, to carry one of the shavings
to your mouth. After a week or two’s experience
you will begin to think that it is not badly flavoured,
nor unusually repugnant to the process of digestion.</p>

<p>It was not, however, my first essay in dining on
mummy beef which brought me to this negative
estimate of its qualities. My dinner, therefore, to-day
was but a frugal one. While its remains were
being removed, our host, to whom in some way or
other our arrival had been communicated, entered the
room, and seating himself on a chair which he had
placed in the middle of it, lighted his pipe, as a preliminary
to conversation. This presented an opportunity
for inquiring whether the resources of the
village could be made to supply a supper that might
in some degree compensate for the shortcomings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
the dinner. To every question a decided negative
was returned. There was, however, one suggestion
the good man could make. A neighbour had a hen; she
might not be unwilling to part with the creature for a
proper consideration; and there would be time to
make it into something for supper. I was horrified. I
looked on the author of the suggestion, seated in the
middle of the room, in his blouse and with his pipe in
his mouth, as an ogre, and who, besides being an
ogre himself, was offensively taking me for a brother
ogre. That this unprepared hen, the pet of the
children, and the familiar acquaintance of all the
village, should have its days, and its career, too, of
usefulness, cut short; that it should be put into the
pot before the life was well out of it, merely to make
a very doubtful addition to my supper! The blood
of the poor bird would be upon me. The first mouthful
would choke me; and that would be only what I
had deserved. I peremptorily forbad the repetition of
so shocking a proposal.</p>

<p>It was now the daughter’s turn, and her suggestion
was soup and a salad. This was a delightful suggestion;
and there could be no doubt but that the soup
and salad would at seven o’clock prove as good as the
suggestion sounded charming. But of what was the
soup to be made? Curiosity could not but be awakened,
though I suppressed it for the present, thinking
it better to give the soup that proof which a pudding
is known to require. In due time the opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
came for applying this proof: but all that it enables
me to say unhesitatingly is—this I say only to those
who can participate in what was my own curiosity—that
herbs, onions, spices, and milk were among the
ingredients. I even lean to the opinion that nothing
more had been put into the pot. First, because these
were all the elements of the composition I could
detect, either by the eye or palate; and next because
there was nothing else in the village that could have
been added except mummy beef, and I cannot believe
that these frugal people would for a moment have
entertained the thought of expending any of their
little store of that precious material for such a purpose.
No: I believe that it was rigidly a <i>potage</i> of herbs;
and that there was in it no element that would have
disqualified it for being placed, at their great annual
festival, before the President of the Vegetarian
Society.</p>

<p>The beds and bedroom were as clean as one could
wish. The basins were coloured pie-dishes; the
goblets were black wine bottles. At five o’clock the
next morning we found that the goodnatured contriver
of the soup had managed to procure some butter
from the alpe for our breakfast. The coffee was
quite up to the usual hotel mark. The bill for dinner,
supper, bed, and breakfast for two persons was 2<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i> 8<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i>;
that there may be no mistake, 3 francs 20 cents.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>August 4.</i>—At Langwies, where the new char-road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
ended, the path for the first time began to descend
towards the valley bottom, which was reached a little
further on. In some places beyond Langwies the
horse-track was quite overgrown with long grass and
nettles. This indicated how little the Pass of the
Strela is used. The scenery had now begun to assume
a new aspect. Up to this time an unusual amount of
bright green grass, and of dark green pine, had been
universal. We were now approaching the head of the
valley, and the grass was assuming the more sober
green of upland pasture, while the forests became less
vigorous in growth, and less profuse in foliage. The
rock, too, where exposed to view, was no longer dark
crumbly slate, but had become of a hard compact
texture, and of a gray tint. At last the stream was
reached, but not crossed; for after keeping upon its
northern bank for a short distance, we had to turn our
backs to it, and to ascend a grassy glade with forest
on either side. The eastern direction, however, was
soon resumed, which soon carried us beyond the last
trees. After a time we had to cross a swollen stream
on the trunk of an unsquared pine, the wooden bridge
having been carried away two days back. Then
passing some Alpine <i lang="fr">châlets</i>, and skirting a lofty
mountain, both on the left, over good Alpine pasture,
we reached the head water of the Plessur. For stepping
across this, upon the stones which form its bed,
you must yourself select a spot, for just hereabouts
there cannot be said to be any pathway. Immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
beyond the stream you begin the last ascent. Here a
good path, over rock-strewn, and unusually flowery
turf, conducts you up a steep ascent, that for half an
hour will shrewdly try your lungs and legs. By that
time you will have reached the top of the Pass of
the Strela. You will now have lifted yourself nearly
6,000 feet above Coire, and will be at an elevation of
nearly 8,000. Grand, naked, rocky summits, free
from weather stains, will rise some thousand feet
higher on your right and left. At first your way lies
over a good expanse of turfy plateau, with some
precipitous rock-faced ravines on the right and on the
left. Before you is a troubled sea of mighty ridges
and multiform summits, many capped and streaked
with snow. Everything is in strong contrast to the
somewhat monotonous green of the two long ranges of
the Schanfiggthal. A little advance brings to your
feet the long valley of Davos, 3,000 feet below you.
At its head, to your left, you look down on the blue-green
surface of the glassy Davoser see. On a quiet
cloudless day you marvel at its reflection of the aerial
azure. The mountains stand round about it, and the
woods come down to its margin, except on the side
nearest to you, where the prairies of the valley reach
up to it. Amid them is the little town of Davos
Dörfli. Somewhat further down the valley, which
soon spreads out to a goodly expanse of softest tinted
grass is the larger town of Davos am Platz, covering
much space, for its houses are much dispersed. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
that full before you, you no longer care to keep to the
horse track, but taking the cattle tracks down the
alpe, which carry you through a fine old larch forest,
you again strike the regular path just before you
enter the town. For a moment, if you have come
from the Schanfiggthal, you will feel some surprise
at finding so many good houses, so many large hotels,
so considerable a town, and so excellent a road, in
such a place. The Kurhaus is an enormous establishment.
Being repelled by its name, and not attracted
by its size, I went on to the hotel Rhätia, at the further,
or southern end of the town, having passed some
other hotels by the way. It was now twelve o’clock,
and as the <i lang="fr">table d’hôte</i> hour was near at hand, I stayed
there for dinner. Chairs were set for 116 guests.
The landlord told me that among them all were but
three English parties. German was the only language
I heard spoken. My experience has brought me to
the conclusion that where this is the case the table is
more bountifully provided, and the charges are less,
than in hotels that are frequented chiefly by English
and Americans. Germans will not submit to be badly
served, or to be overcharged. Englishmen are generally
indisposed to assert their rights in matters of
this kind. And if they had the disposition, they
seldom have sufficient command of the language to
enable them to wrangle glibly with hotel authorities.</p>

<p>The contrast between the valley I had left and
the valley I had now entered, as I have just said, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
great; but still greater was the contrast between the
human life of the one and of the other. There was
an awning along the south side of the hotel. At one
end of this, where it was of considerable depth, the
seats were arranged in a square: this part of the
space, now that dinner was over, was occupied by
ladies and children. The other end, where there was
only a single bench against the wall, was assigned to
the gentlemen, who, as they took their after-dinner
cigar, were conversing upon the condition of Europe,
and other questions of the day. In the road was a
constant succession of parties, departing, some on
foot, and some in <i>chars</i>, for an afternoon excursion.
The contentment of rest after exertion, aided by the
narcotic leaf, disposed to dreaminess, and would not
allow present objects quite to overpower and obliterate
recent impressions. The bloused landlord of
Peist, with his short pipe in his mouth, and his good-natured
daughter, who had earned their three francs
and twenty cents with so much unaffected kindly
attention, and the villagers, who during the long
winter meet to spin in each other’s houses, that they
may effect some little savings of firing and lights,
and at the same time have a little talk about the
affairs of the village, their world, would not be displaced
from my thoughts. Each order of impressions
somewhat deprived the other of reality. Each
became a concurrent dream, or the two together
formed themselves into a single confused dream.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
The fantoccini figures of the one story jostled those
of the other story for possession of the stage in the
brain. For the time one felt no longer as an actor
in life, but merely as a spectator of life. Human
concerns became a spectacle, which only suggested
evanescent fragments of half-formed thought.</p>

<p>The cigar mentioned at the close of the last chapter
had come to an end. This brought me to the question
of where I would go next? Where and how?
Had I stood alone in the world, that is to say, on
this afternoon at Davos am Platz, without having to
consider the incapacities and wishes of so uncertain
an instrument as my neophyte porter, I should by
whatever conveyance might have offered have sent
my belongings some dozen miles down the valley,
and have followed them on foot. Now, however, I
was tied to him, and there were symptoms that he
was not disposed for any more work to-day. First
he had in the morning complained much of the ascent
of the Strela; and again when we had arrived at
Davos am Platz, I had told him that we would have
a halt of two hours, and would then decide on what
was to be done with the rest of the day: but he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
allowed nearly three hours to pass before his reappearance.
This I interpreted to mean that he
wished to shorten the afternoon’s work as much as
possible; or, if he could so manage it, to prevent
anything at all being undertaken in the afternoon.
These, then, were disturbing elements in the question:
if I were to proceed on foot, he might be somewhat
crippled for future work, or demoralized from a consciousness
that his devices had been seen through
and thwarted. I decided, therefore, to go on that
evening to Alveneu Bad, 16¹⁄₂ miles, by <i>char</i>. We
soon found that at this time of day our inquiries
were too late: all the public vehicular resources of
the place had been taken up by the numerous afternoon
excursionists. I then bethought myself of trying
its private resources in this matter. In this, by
the assistance of the porter of the Kurhaus, I was
successful; and at 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we started for Alveneu Bad
in the private carriage of one of the magnates of the
little town. The carriage and harness were quite
new, and the horse was, evidently, well cared for.
The good man and his wife stood by to see the departure
of their lately acquired turn-out, and to impress
to the last on the driver the necessity of care
and caution. When we had been gone about half an
hour, a passing shower drifted down the valley. I
hoped that those drops did not reach as far as Davos
am Platz, that they might not be felt by the anxious
old couple, though I was sure that even in that case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
their hearts would revive within them when they
thought of the 22 francs they were to receive to-morrow
morning.</p>

<p>There is a new and excellent post-road all the way
to the Bad which is on the new Albula road. This new
Davos road is a continuation of that of the Prätigäu.
It is carried at first along smooth prairies, backed by
lofty wooded mountains. The stream by its side is
the Landwasser, which as it drains many valleys has
a considerable volume of water. At last the mountains
close in, and completely squeeze out the prairies.
There is then no more room for the road, which is,
therefore, at this point carried up and over the mountain
on the right bank of the Landwasser to Wiesen.
Beyond Wiesen the road runs along the mountain
flanks above, and some way back from, the Landwasser.
This gives you commanding views of the
ranges and summits to your left between the parallel
valleys of Davos and the Engadin. The scene is
impressive. Below you is the deep valley of the
Landwasser. Towards the bottom on the opposite
side are bright green prairies and dull green pine
woods; these are overtopped by lofty mountains,
streaked by long deep slaty-coloured <i>couloirs</i> from top
to bottom. Other mountains, behind these, seen
through gaps, after showing a zone of black rock,
were capped with snow from which the rays of the
western sun were now gleaming. One in particular
appeared to invite climbing, for its zone of black rock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
slanted up with what seemed to be a practicable slope
to the snowy summit: of course, however, till a trial
has been made one can only speak of such appearances
as possibilities. In several places along the valley the
new road, though only just completed, had already led
to the erection of new houses and hotels. This will
go on everywhere in Switzerland; and by the time all
the available sites are occupied there, tourists will
have begun to flood the Tyrol and overflow into the
Carpathians.</p>

<p>Our horse was willing, and the driver not unwilling,
and so we reached the Bad before dark. I found here
about fifty people just seated down to supper. I was
told that they were chiefly Swiss, many of them from
the eastern cantons. Family parties, in which the
middle-aged element largely entered, were in preponderance.
It was evident that they had much to say
to each other; and saying this probably did them as
much good as drinking the waters.</p>

<p><i>August 6.</i>—Having been delayed three quarters of
an hour by the dilatoriness, or the scheming, of the
circumnavigator, did not get under weigh till 5.45.
As we left the house a funeral was passing the door.
To us this might seem an early and a cold hour for
taking a deceased relative to his last earthly resting
place. We might almost feel as if there was in such
an arrangement something hurried, some impatience,
an unfair curtailment of his last glimpse of the sun.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
But, then, it reduces to a minimum the demand which
the ceremony must make on the working hours of the
mourners’ day. We were now on the Albula road.
It here skirts the stream of the Albula, which our late
companion, the Landwasser had now joined. In a
little more than an hour, Tiefenkasten was reached,
where the Oberhalbstein Rhine enters the Albula. In
an hour more we were on the bridge of Solis. Upon
this part of the road we crossed a long array of
diligences and <i>chars</i>. They were from Thusis, which
had been reached from Reichenau on the Coire-Andermatt
road, or by the Splügen; and were on
their way to the Engadin by the route either of the
Albula, or of the Julier.</p>

<p>At the bridge of Solis you cross the Albula,
chafing and fretting below you at a depth of 250 feet.
From this point you enter on the new Schyn-strasse,
a grand piece of road, and similar in character to its
neighbour, the Via Mala of the Splügen route. For
three miles, or more, it is grooved out, or built upon
the side of a narrow deep ravine, several hundred feet
above the rushing, tumbling Albula, and with several
times as many hundred feet above the road; sheer and
sharply shelving precipices below and above; and
with the corresponding opposite parallel side of the
ravine closely confronting you, to demonstrate to you
how utterly impracticable was the construction of the
road along which you are walking with unusual ease,
for it has throughout been engineered, with scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
any gradients, on one general level. Of course a road
of this kind must have some tunnels, and, in places
where it is crossed by <i>couloirs</i>, galleries to protect it
from being occasionally buried, or carried away; and
its bridges must be made capable of withstanding
storm-swollen torrents. Some will think it worth
while to give a passing glance at these bridges to see
what were the difficulties the engineer had to contend
with, and the dangers he had to provide against. In
one place I saw that provision had been made below
a bridge, to prevent the torrent from deepening its
bed back to the bridge in any direction except at
right angles to a line drawn across the centre of the
arch of the bridge, because a deviation from this line
to the right, or left, would have destroyed the foundation
of one or other of the piers of the bridge. A
torrent towards the western end of the Strasse had
cut the strata of rock over which it fell into a somewhat
regular flight of steps. The layers of rock were
two or three feet thick, and each was cut down
perpendicularly by the stream, some three or four feet
in advance of the one which was above it. So almost
down to the bridge, where the stream entirely disappeared,
in consequence of the stratification having
here been abruptly tilted into an inclination that was
not far from perpendicular; and here the torrent had
formed for itself a channel by eroding only one of the
layers of rock, and that to such a depth that the layers
on our right completely overlapped and concealed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
stream which had been carried down some way below
in the eroded layer.</p>

<p>The ravine of the Schyn nowhere admits of any
kind of cultivation, not even of an occasional patch
of grass. Pines are its only produce. Among these
I saw towards its western extremity many fine specimens
of the silver fir, which I had nowhere previously
noticed. I do not see why the Douglas pine, one of
the most rapid in growth, and valuable as timber, of
all the conifers, should not be grown largely in Switzerland.
Some of its moist and sheltered valleys
would seem to be the very stations that might in
every respect be exactly suited for it. It has been
proved that it will grow rapidly in such places. In
this, as in many other ravines, a track for removing
the trees that have been felled below the road, is out
of the question. If, therefore, they are to be used for
fuel, they are cut into pieces, six feet in length, and
pitched into the torrent, which transports them
rapidly to their destination. Fuel that has been
torrent-borne in this way may readily be distinguished,
as it stands piled against the walls of the
houses, by the manner in which the ends of the
pieces have been bruised and frayed. If, however,
what has been felled is to be used as timber for
building, the length required would make it impossible
to float it down such narrow, rocky, and tortuous
streams. In this case winter must be waited
for, and when it has frozen the torrent, and buried it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
beneath the snow, the hardy and industrious peasants
avail themselves of the temporary pathway nature
has provided, and haul their timber along it. But
these winter pathways are not free from danger, for it
sometimes happens that a rock, detached by the frost
from an overhanging summit, falls on those who are
at work below.</p>

<p>As you descend from the Schyn to Thusis everything
is changed. You again find yourself among
prairies, fruit trees, and scattered dwellings. A broad
green valley lies before you expanding to the right
and left, in which are the towns of Sils and Thusis;
and beyond the valley is lifted up the broad shelving
expanse of the eastern side of the Heinzenberg,
a wide, unbroken expanse of trees and prairies, enlivened
with many villages, and innumerable detached
<i lang="fr">châlets</i>. You see that every rood of it is turned to the
best account, and that it is on the spot supporting a
large and industrious population.</p>

<p>As you descend you pass the still solid remains of
an old castle on the right, perched on a cliff overlooking
the Albula. Another is above you on the
mountain side. At the foot of the descent you reach
the little town of Sils, separated by three-quarters of
a mile of bottom land from Thusis, which you see on
the first rise of the opposite bank, beyond the Hinter-Rhein,
the stream of the valley. A third old castle,
that of Hohen Rhätien, looks down on Thusis from
the brow of a cliff, 400 feet above the stream, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
what is still your side of the valley. As you cross
the bridge, on its up stream side you see the Rhine
rushing beneath it in a flood of whitish green. Immediately
below the bridge the inky Nolla, more
inky than the Tyne at Newcastle, its blackness is
that of the skin of an unfledged rook, pitches its
torrent of defilement into the whitish green stream.
You feel that this is an act of disrespect to a main
branch of so famous a river. Two hundred, or so,
yards further on you pass a second bridge, that of
the Nolla itself. You now see above the bridge what
a vast amount of small black shaly <i>débris</i>, the cause
of its inkiness, this stream brings down in its course
from the summits of the Heinzenberg, and of the Piz
Beverin. You had also just noticed some acres of
this dark <i>débris</i> outspread on the broad, and now dry,
sides of the channel below the Rhine bridge. The
Nolla, then, you will remember as a kind of natural
ink factory; and may think, too, that it has been
pouring forth its torrent of ink from a date long anterior
to the Chinese or Egyptian manufacture of the
pigment.</p>

<p>Thusis commences a few steps beyond the bridge
of the Nolla. The first house on the right side of the
long street of which it is composed is the chief hotel
of the place. We walked up to the door, and stood
on the step. A four-horse carriage was about to
start for the Splügen, and the landlord was impressively
reiterating his adieux, and his wishes for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
pleasant journey, to its occupants. For two or three
minutes I waited, but as he did not think it worth his
while to salute with a word the coming guest, or to
beg to be excused for a moment, that he might pile
up still higher his good wishes for his departing
guests, I asked the circumnavigator to resume his
burden, and went on to the hotel de la Poste, at the
further end of the opposite side of the long street.
Mine host that might have been now saw that,
though it was well done to speed the guest parting
with four horses, it was ill done not to welcome also
the guest arriving on foot. But in this case the
coming guest hardened his heart, and no place was
given for repentance. The hotel de la Poste had its
advantages. It was not yet 12 o’clock, and as my
companion had been limping for the last hour, I saw
that I should be obliged to sleep at Thusis; and
when you have nothing to do, it is something to have
even the arrivals and departures of the diligences to
look at. Some of those who come, or who are waiting
to go, by them will perhaps have something to
say; at all events you see something of what manner
of people they are. And then the telegraph bureau
is at hand, and you can, which it is always pleasing to
do, in a few moments ask your travelling friends what
they are about, and tell them where you are. This is
very different from, and far better than, writing and
receiving letters. It is so near an approach to direct,
actual conversation. Letters belong to quite a different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
category. By the time a letter is received all
your plans, or those of your friends, may have been
altered. You may be going in an opposite direction
to that announced. Your feelings may have become
the reverse of those described. Regrets, or rejoicings,
may have been called into being on grounds that
never came to have any existence. But telegrams,
which tell friends where they respectively are, and
how they are, at the moment, are present indubitable
realities.</p>

<p>Being then obliged to remain at Thusis for the
rest of the day, I went in the afternoon to see the old
castle of Hohen Rhätien. The ruins of one of these
mediæval strongholds cannot, generally, be regarded
with much interest, because gratitude is no ingredient
in the feelings which the sight of it awakens. The
stage of history to which they belong was rather a
painful interruption, than a satisfactory continuance,
of the progress of human affairs. Its units, represented
by these castles, were small fragments of rude
force; and these were but ill-compacted into rude
wholes, that hardly deserved the name of states. The
strong owners of these castles were prompted by a
consciousness of their strength to lives of violence
and oppression, and the weak were obliged to attach
themselves to the strong, only to be oppressed. The
physical ruled the moral and intellectual without
disguise and without mitigation, except so far as it
was counteracted by what soon became the moral and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
intellectual tyranny of the Church. Of the evils of
this system we even suppose that we have not yet
reached the end, but that we are still in some degree
suffering from them. For reasons of this kind we
are indisposed to see in it, what history tells us we
ought, the first step in the new order of things to
which we belong, and which we may hope has grander
possibilities for us than the preceding order of things
in the old world had for those of its day; or, indeed,
to see in it anything but an assertion of force and injustice,
which for a long period altogether forbad, and
the consequences of which may be still somewhat
hindering, the advance of society in the direction of
fair and reasonable institutions. It is with very
different feelings that we contemplate the monuments
of Greece and Rome, and even of old Egypt; for
they do not, as these do, remind us of mere individual
brute force. They were works of organized societies,
whose wants were of a more human and cultured
kind, and whose mistakes and misdeeds, as their
consequences are now no longer felt, are almost lost
to memory. At all events we owe them much.
The very ruins of their buildings remind us of one
part of the debt. But we cannot, or will not, feel in
this way towards the owners of these old castles. In
passing, therefore, the remains of one of them many
of us have no wish to inspect it. It is not sacred
ground to us. What pleases us most in the matter
is the fact, visible in passing it, that it is in ruins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>For such reasons as these, while a little before
midday I had looked up at the ruins of the old castle
of Hohen Rhätien, I had not thought them worth the
hour or so that would have been required for going
up to see them; but now in the afternoon, having
nothing else to do, I inspected them with some
attention. To get to them I had to recross the two
bridges. I then, about 200 yards beyond that over
the Hinter Rhein, crossed a small mill-race running
parallel to the road, and went straight up a steep
timber-slide, which is visible from the road. At the
head of this you come on the regular horse-track, from
Sils to the castle. Three or four hundred yards of
this bring you to a steep turfy slope, where you may
desert the horse path which winds round the summit
to the top, and in five minutes you will be on the top
among the ruins. They consist of several detached
buildings. The first is a square tower with thick walls.
It has no door, or constructed entrance, in the walls that
now remain, the only access to the interior being by a
hole in one of the angles. We may, therefore, suppose
that this was an advanced outwork, that was entered
either by a subterranean gallery which connected it with
the castle some hundred yards off, or by a ladder which
was applied to some aperture in an upper story which
has now disappeared from the walls. It may also
have been useful as a storehouse for provisions of
some kind or other. Next to this is a structure, which
evidently was a small church. It is in good preservation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
The tower still stands. Alongside of the
tower is a chamber with a groined ceiling, which may,
possibly, have been the chancel. In line with, so as
to be a continuation of, this chamber is the nave of the
church. The two windows that alone lighted it are
very narrow; but, then, in this part of the world
windows are made as small as possible, for to admit a
sufficiency of light would, for the greater part of the
year, be to admit an intolerable quantity of cold.</p>

<p>Close to the church, in the direction of the castle,
is a building about twenty feet square. The walls
are about three feet thick. Their stones in some
courses are laid horizontally, in others in a slanting,
or herringbone, position. Close to this is another
building similarly constructed, but more dilapidated.
This is not quite so wide as it is long. It has remains
of a floor above the ground floor.</p>

<p>Just beyond these two last mentioned buildings is
the true castle. It is of very solid construction, but
of no great extent. I paced it, but do not remember
its exact dimensions. My impression is that it is not
so much as a square of forty feet. Neither the door,
nor windows, were arched. The latter are in the form
of embrasures, much recessed, of course to admit to
the interior as much light as possible through such
small openings, and to enable its defenders to command
as much space as possible outside. The lowest of
these embrasures is at a considerable height from the
ground. Half the basement is occupied by a spacious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
excavation in the living rock, which doubtless was the
cellar. This is the first necessity in every dwelling
place in this part of Switzerland, where the winters
are so severe, and some days in summer very hot.
If the cellar of a house does not prove good, that is to
say, if it should prove incapable of keeping wine,
cheese, milk, beer, meat, and in these days potatoes,
from the cold of winter and the heat of summer, the
house itself is of little value. This large rock-cellar
doubtless answered well the purpose for which it was
designed. I pictured it to myself stored with hogsheads
of wine, barrels of flour, salt beef and bacon,
and tiers of cheese, against the annually recurrent
siege of winter, or an expected summer siege from the
lord of some neighbouring castle. There was plenty
of everything, for those were days when rapid digestion
waited upon vigorous appetite, and eating and
drinking were the great business of life. There were
three stories. The large stone fire-place of the first of
these remains. Its chimney is carried up, and against,
the inner wall, almost as if it had been an after-thought.
Does the existence of this chimney throw
any light on the date of the structure? We can
hardly suppose such a chimney of earlier date than
the fourteenth century, but as it appears to have been
applied to the wall, and not constructed in it, the wall
may be of much greater age than the chimney. There
are no traces of chimneys elsewhere in the building.
A court-yard surrounded the castle. This included<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
at the angle, between the two precipitous faces
of the extremity of the mountain, a space that might
have been a garden, or a yard for the live stock in
troublous times. It is now laid down in grass for
mowing. The castle itself did not stand upon the
edge of the precipice. Between it and the precipice,
indeed on the very edge of it, are the remains of some
small buildings. These, as probably did the three
other buildings first mentioned, must have supplied
the stabling for horses and cattle, and storehouses for
provisions and hay in ordinary times. The church
could not have been intended for more than thirty or
forty people. This, and the small dimensions of the
castle itself, furnish us with some data for forming an
estimate of the wealth and power of its original
builder, and of his successors. One cannot suppose
that his retainers comprised more than about a dozen
families. And perhaps the same may be said of the
retainers of those who possessed the dozen other
castles of the immediate neighbourhood. In descending
I took the regular old road down to Sils, for
I wished to go the way the old feudal chief and his
retainers had used. To one either going to, or
coming from Thusis, this way is quite a mile longer
than the timber slide.</p>

<p>These may, as we are told they are, be the remains
of the oldest castle in Switzerland; but their
situation, as well as their character, demonstrate that
the explanation given of the name is erroneous.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Livy tells us that, at the time of the settlement of the
Gauls in northern Italy, the Etruscans they displaced
moved off to, and took possession of the district of
which the Grisons of our day form a part. In
classical times it was called Rhætia, to explain which
name, a leader of the emigration of the name of
Rhætus was invented. This tradition is supposed to
be supported by the assumptions that the name of
Thusis is derived from Tuscia, and that the name by
which this old castle is now known has come down
from the times of Rhætus, its presumed original
founder. The tradition, however, affirms an improbability.
No invaders, settling themselves among a
dispossessed and hostile population, would have constructed
so small a fortress, which could have given
shelter to only a very small garrison. Nor would they
have placed it in such a situation: for there being then
no road below Thusis, it would have been at the bottom
of a <i>cul de sac</i>, and any one who could have held and
devastated the valley, would have starved out the
little garrison of the castle. We may, therefore,
pretty safely conclude that it belongs to the same
date as the church, that is to say, to the times, when
feudal lords, who under the conditions of the period
implied castles, were a necessity. The great number
there was of them at that time in the valley was a
kind of common insurance to each against some of
the risks to which they would otherwise have been
exposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>We read a good deal in Swiss histories of the way
in which in many places the peasants rose against
their feudal lords, expelled or killed them, and dismantled
or burnt their castles. At all events there
was once an abundance of these lords, and we cannot
suppose that they voluntarily abandoned their strongholds,
and their lands. We see the ruins of a great
many of these strongholds, and we see the peasants
now in possession of the lands which once supported
these strongholds. This, if like things are to be
called by like names, is neither more nor less than
what French, German, Italian, and Spanish Internationalists
are aiming at. Here, in these valleys,
as far as the land is concerned, their scheme has for
many generations been thoroughly carried out.
Lands which feudal lords once held peasants now
hold. The substitution of one proprietary for the
other was in many cases brought about by the direct
use of physical force, in others by the peaceable, it
might have been, expression of the will of the community,
backed, however, by physical force: which
comes to precisely the same thing. And now this
peasant proprietorship has had several centuries to
develop its nature completely, without any retarding,
or disturbing causes operating against it. Whatever
merits, therefore, and whatever demerits the system
may have, may be seen here, for no one would assert
that it can be without either the one, or the other.
Some estimate of each I endeavoured to make in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
first ‘Month in Switzerland’ of two years back; and
in my second ‘Month’ of last year, I endeavoured to
direct attention to the history, and to the present
action, in this age of capital, of the Allmends, or
commonable lands of Switzerland, which in the days
anterior to accumulations of capital were, in Switzerland
at all events, a necessary appendage to peasant
proprietorship. All that I now wish to remark is
that that portion of the land which is held as private
property, has for a long time been divided into such
small holdings, and from absence of settlements,
trusts, and charges, has been so completely at the
disposal of existing proprietors, as would probably
satisfy the most extreme Internationalist, who was in
favour of permitting any private rights at all in the
land.</p>

<p>In human affairs, however, nothing continues long
in one stay; and their progress has at length given
rise in these valleys to a new and enlarged development
of one of the instruments of production, which
formerly existed in them only in the germ, but is
now seen to have greater capabilities than have
hitherto been found in the land itself: at all events
it is one to which the uses of, and the property in,
land must now accommodate themselves. This disturbing
element, this instrument of production, the
powers of which have of late been so much enlarged,
is capital in money. And neither the Internationalist,
nor anybody else who interests himself about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
mixed questions of economics and politics, can arrive
at any safe or workable conclusions, unless he so far
understands its uses, action, and power, as to see
that without it society would collapse, and revert to
barbarism. We may, perhaps, get a little glimpse
into the question of what are its uses, action, and
power, if we divide the inhabitants of these thriving
valleys into those who are supported by capital in
money, and those who are supported by capital in
land, and then endeavour to see how each class is
living. I propose the division in the above form,
because I suppose that ultimately, and in the nature
of things, there is no scientific ground for the assumption,
implied in popular usage, of there being a fundamental
difference, when they are regarded as means
of production, between land and money, or even
between either of these two and labour. They are all
I imagine, in a broad and true generalization, capital.
They seem to be all means of production, and so only
different forms of capital. Still the division proposed
is one with which we are familiar, and which is intelligible,
at least to the eye. To proceed, then, with
it: it is clear that a man, and one, too, who was the
son of a peasant, can now live here, and live better,
than any of the peasant proprietors have for generations
lived, without owning, or occupying, a <i>klafter</i>
of land. Many are doing this. Every year a greater
number do it. What is required for doing it is
thought, knowledge, the power of seeing far, and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
combining divers facts and considerations, energy,
perseverance, and character. It is to be done not so
much by the hands as by the brain. That is the
chief human instrument to be used. The field to be
cultivated is not a little piece of land for supplying
directly a man’s own wants, but his efforts must aim primarily
at the supply of the wants of others, in a sense
of the world. This, however, is only possible through
the existence and the use of capital in money. For
this purpose money has two distinct functions. First
it is the common measure not only of all the useful
and exchangeable productions of the world and of
man, but also of all that contributes to their production,
whether the human means as labour, skill, and
knowledge, or the material means as the land and the
requisite tools, implements, and machinery: in short,
it renders both the human and the material means
of production, and the commodities produced, all
commensurable. In the second place it enables us,
practically, to store up surplus produce of any kind
in such a form as to be reconvertible at will into
produce of any kind, or into the means of production.
In these ways it correlates all the wants and all
the capabilities of the whole family of man, dispersed
over the world, putting each country into reciprocal
relations with all the others. It enables each to
produce whatever it may have any natural capacity
for producing, and to exchange it for whatever it may
want. And this it does not only between different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
nations, but also between the different individuals
of the same nation, and of the same neighbourhood.
This is a field, the cultivation of some part of which
generally yields to its cultivator a far greater return
than can by any amount of individual labour be
extracted from two or three acres with some appurtenant
rights of fuel and pasturage. And now if
we turn to those who are living on the hard-won
produce of their few acres, we see that their lives, too,
have been greatly elevated and embellished by the
existence and applications of capital in money. It
might be shown that to it they were indebted for
their education, and for the opportunities they have
had for starting their children in the world. It has
given them the means of travelling very cheaply at
the rate of twenty miles an hour; it has given them
the means of communicating with the world by the
post and by the telegraph; it has brought to their
door opportunities for earning something from the
travellers that visit their neighbourhood; to it they
owe their newspaper; it, too, has enabled them to
procure coffee, sugar, wine, cheap clothing, and many
other minor advantages. Annihilate capital, and
every man throughout these valleys, and throughout
the world, is debarred from access to the products of
the world, and reduced to the miserable life that is
limited to what he can produce with his own hands.
Increase capital, which means ultimately, and in its
largest sense, the store of useful commodities the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
whole world may be made to yield, and the human
and material means requisite for production, and for
distribution, and then there is opened to every man
the possibility of entering by his own labour, or skill,
or knowledge, up to the amount of their productiveness,
into the possession of everything he needs, that
any part of the world is capable of supplying. The
way to enter on their possession is at all events
opened to him, and the command over them to which
he may attain will depend mainly upon himself, that
is to say, upon the way in which he was brought up,
and what he was taught. Whether he is ever to rise
to the possession and management of any portion of
the money capital of the world will depend almost
entirely on how he was brought up, and what he was
taught. When all this shall be seen more distinctly
than it now is by some of us, the Internationalist,
who is himself a creation of money capital, will not
perhaps have so much to say as he has at present
about the tyranny of capital.</p>

<p>But to go back to our Swiss valleys. It is clear
that there has issued from the peasantry, who till
recently were their only inhabitants, a class of men
who are living a higher life than the peasants, that is
than the landed proprietors. It is the life of those
who accumulate capital in money, and who live upon
the employment of it. And this capital in money is,
under the circumstances of the country, within the
reach of every one to far higher amounts in value<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
than is the land, the old form of capital. What is
needed for its acquisition is cultivated intelligence, and
certain moral qualities. This is precisely the point
to which the attention and the efforts of the Internationalists
should be directed. If society takes care,
and it is endeavouring to do this in Switzerland, to
give to all its members as fair a chance as is possible
under existing circumstances to attain to this culture
of the intelligence, and to these moral qualities, the
majority will more or less avail themselves of the
opportunities offered to them; and so, having
numbers, wealth, intelligence, justice, and moral character
on their side, will be too strong to be disturbed
by the <i lang="la">residuum</i>. The son of an Upper Engadin
peasant, who had gone out into the world like
most of his countrymen, there learnt German and
French, and made some money, and now, having returned
home with what he had made, was turning it
to good account, remarked to me, ‘Our education is
improving, but already we have enough of it to enable
those, who are disposed to avail themselves of it, to
get on in the world. The rest are brutish, and must
live by brute work.’ For a moment I was shocked
at the hardness of the statement: but I made no
reply, for I saw that it was no more than the action
of the inexorable law of natural selection applied to
moral and intellectual life. It would not be a law
were it not inexorable. The analogy, too, of nature
requires that it should be applied to man as well as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
the lower animals and to plants; and, indeed, if
exemptions from it were admissible in any part of
the general scheme, they would be admissible least of
all in the case of man, for it is of more importance to
guard against deterioration that which is highest and
best, if we may so speak of any part of the general
scheme, than that which is of inferior value—at all
events than that which to us appears to occupy a
lower place in the scale of being.</p>

<p><i>August 7.</i>—As I foresaw that I should not to-day
get beyond Andeer, I breakfasted in a leisurely style
at seven o’clock, without at all feeling that my loins
were girded, and my staff in my hand. The head
waiter, a very incarnation of good nature and harmless
vanity, availed himself of the opportunity for
trying to persuade me to delay my departure till the
evening, or still better till to-morrow, that I might see
General von Göben, who, as he impressively informed
me, was to arrive to-day with a party of seven,
and had taken the whole of the first floor. At
Dissentis I was told that Von Moltke had been there;
and at Pontresina, and elsewhere, I heard of other
German celebrities. At the places where we ourselves
most do congregate we find many Germans;
but as they do not much desire our society, and do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
not go to Switzerland for precisely the same objects
as ourselves, we must not judge by the proportion of
them we find in these places of the number of them
who are travelling in Switzerland. The elders and
middle-aged among them much affect Bads. At
such places as Davos am Platz and Tarasp they may
be counted by the hundred. But even at these places
we do not see their largest contingent. That is composed
of the young and active, who wish to see the
mountains, and who do all their work on foot. These
are dispersed, like an army of skirmishers, over the
whole country. In my excursion of this year, which
took me on foot over between three and four hundred
miles, and fifteen so called Passes, I nowhere met on
the road a single Englishman, (had the Passes been
difficult ones my experience, perhaps, would have been
different,) but I seldom, if ever, passed a day without
meeting several Germans, generally in parties of
three, without a porter. We may to some extent
judge of the degree to which Alpinism has penetrated
the German mind by the fact, that, while our Alpine
Club numbers 300 members, theirs numbers 3,000.
I have no means of verifying these figures. I only
give them as I found them in a Swiss newspaper.
The same authority informed me that the Swiss
Alpine Club now counts 1,700 members. Still what
there may be of fact in the above statements indicates
that mountaineering is not only a more accessible,
but also a more popular, pursuit with them than with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
us. There must be some reason for this. Can the
reason be that among them culture is both broader in
itself, and more widely diffused than among ourselves?
These people, too, are more gregarious and sociable
than we are; perhaps some causes of repulsion that
are operative here may not be felt among them; and
so they may travel in larger parties than are common
with us.</p>

<p>At 7.30 started for the Via Mala. A cloudless
morning. The freshness of the air, the clearness of the
light, the depth of the blue combined to stimulate the
nerves both of body and mind, and prepared me for
feeling all the effects of the expected wonders of the
scene; or as it is unwise ever to expect anything, for
appreciating highly whatever the walk might present
to me. As I walked along, looking down precipices
between lofty pine stems, as straight and round as if
they had been turned in a lathe, to the broken foamy
thread of the Hinter Rhein in the bottom, and then
up 1,600 feet of opposite black precipice, on the
summit of which, here and there, a lofty pine broke
the sky-line, but showing at that height no bigger
than a hop-pole, the circumnavigator, understanding
how my mind was engaged, and perhaps himself a
little touched by the scene, propounded the only
remark he made on the scenery during the eight days
he was with me. ‘If a man,’ quoth he, ‘Sydney-way,
had this gully on his run, he might make any amount
of money by showing it. Any amount!’ For the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
moment I was a little taken by surprise; but it was
no more than an unexpected application of his
governing idea—which I had already had served up
in many forms, and those not always quite <i lang="la">à propos</i> to
what was before us—that the only good of anything
in the world was its capacity for being turned into
money. Having been brought up to work at his
trade from 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> for seven francs a week,
(the wages paid at Poschiavo in those days,) he had come
to hate and despise labour; and his Australian experiences,
acting on a Swiss substratum, had made him
an ideologist, but of one idea, that one being that the
one sure way to the one great object was to buy cheap,
and to sell dear. Again and again he had repeated
to me that this was the way in which all the money
in the world that had been made honestly had been
made. But he never could explain how the money
that was given in the good price had been made,
except by the same process of selling dear. Those,
he maintained, who had been most pre-eminently successful
in life were those who had most thoroughly
carried out the rule, perhaps without an undeviating
regard for honesty. He had not succeeded at Sydney,
because ice was so dear there; that is to say because
ices could not be made without ice. The liquor trade
had great capacities, because there are other things in
the barrel besides liquor. The world, and its money-making
inhabitants were to him only an enlarged
edition of the two American lads, who during their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
journey in a railway car, without leaving their seats,
made each of them a large fortune by an incessant
repetition of the process of swapping what they had
about them. I had little to say just now to his remarks,
for what of the world was before me indisposed
me to transfer my thoughts to the antipodes, or even
to say anything on behalf of labour and thrift, and of
honesty, in reply to his narrow and unfavourable experiences
of life.</p>

<p>The Via Mala though of the same character as
the Schyn is both more diversified and more astonishing.
The roadway itself is wider, and of more solid
construction than that of its neighbour; nor is it
all on one general level, for, as you advance along it,
you are generally ascending or descending. It also
crosses from side to side, being carried over the stream
by bridges, which here it has been necessary to build
at a great height above the stream. The ravine, too,
is not so uniformly wedge-shaped, but in places the
opposite side will appear to be almost, or perhaps
will be quite, perpendicular. There is indeed one instance
of its actually leaning towards you. The
hammers and chisels of the old world would never
have made this road. Gunpowder it was that rendered
its construction possible, and we may almost
say that made the want of it felt. It first made the
old castles indefensible, and the man-at-arms as good
a man in the field as the armoured knight; in other
words it first helped to sweep away such impediments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
to production, freedom of exchange, and accumulation
as the Hohen Rhätiens of mediæval Europe;
and when they were gone, and in consequence production
had increased, and facilities for communication
became necessary, what had aided in abolishing
the castles was found capable also of aiding in the
construction of the road. We may suppose that the
inventors of this explosive, as has been the case with
most inventions, had no glimpse of the good work it
would accomplish. They could have had no anticipations
of its disestablishing feudalism, and constructing
roads through the Alps. And even now we seem to
be only feeling our way to some guesses of what will
be the kind of work it will do in any future war, that
is to say what effect it will have on the history of the
future.</p>

<p>I observed as I was advancing along this Via
Mala, in what good keeping with the sombreness of
the ravines was the monotonous form of the pines.
Were its trees of the kinds that are spreading in limb,
and varied in form and foliage, it would imply that
nature was more benignant than the other features of
the scene suggest. But as it is, you find that only
one kind of tree can live here, and that a little
thought shows you is so constructed as to enable it to
withstand the heavy snowfalls and violent gales of
winter. Its branches are so short, perhaps somewhat
shorter than they would be with us, and, too, so constructed,
that they never can be called upon to sustain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
any great weight of snow, and the trunk tapers
so regularly, like a well-made fishing rod, as to enable
it to sustain the most sudden and violent storm
blasts. The top yields to the pressure, but does not
snap, because the stiffness of the stem is gradually increasing;
and this, before the bottom has been
reached, has increased to such a degree as to prevent
any strain being felt by the roots. As you observe
this adaptation of form and structure, the hardness of
the conditions of the station that are inferred deepens
the effect upon your thought of the hardness of the
conditions that are seen.</p>

<p>At Thusis we had been told that the storm of the
previous Sunday night had so swollen the Hinter
Rhein as to have raised the water to within a few
feet of the crown of the arch of the bridge. At the
other extremity of the Via Mala—the place is called
Reischen—we found that a bridge had been swept
away. This had interrupted the traffic for twenty-four
hours, when those who had charge of the road
succeeded in laying some pine trunks across the
chasm, and forming upon them a roadway of transverse
squared slabs. We stopped a few minutes to
see the diligence pass this improvised structure.
The three leaders were taken out, as there was some
chance that the dancing and rattling of the loose
slabs might scare them. With this precaution the
passage was effected easily.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that on the first afternoon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
of this excursion I inspected the deep perpendicular
channel of the Aare on the eastern side of the
Kirchet to see if it presented any indications of its
having been formed by any other agency than that of
the stream that is now running through it. Every
indication seemed to imply that the channel had been
eroded by the stream, and by it alone. Every deep
channel I passed, throughout this excursion, I looked
at with the same thought in my mind, and I nowhere
saw anything to suggest the operation of any other
agent. And in this ravine, the most perpendicular
and deepest of them all, I saw nothing that pointed
to a different conclusion. Here a single arch is sufficient
to carry you over the stream at a height of 300
feet above it. It is impossible to suppose but that
the whole of these 300 feet were excavated by the
stream that is now fretting at the bottom of them.
If, then, you are certain that it cut out the 300 feet
below you, what, except your niggardly ideas about
the extent of past time, is there to prevent your supposing
that it cut out the 1,300 feet above you? Believe
the evidence of your eyes in this matter, and it
will add a hundredfold to the interest with which you
will contemplate this grand example of the method in
which nature makes a stream cut a channel for itself
through a mountain of solid rock. You will think
how long she has been engaged in the work, and that
she is now carrying it on with the same instrument,
and applied in the same fashion, as thousands and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
thousands of years ago. The reason why in these
gorges the rock is cut with comparative rapidity is
that in them the stream is always both rapid and
confined. Because it is rapid it is working with the
greatest possible power, and because it is narrow that
greatest power is applied at the greatest possible advantage,
that is to say it is confined to the central
straight line of the narrow bottom, for all the sand
and stones are turned in from each side to that
central line. Hence the rapidity, narrowness, and
directness of the cutting action. When, however, the
stream has passed out of the gorge into more level
ground, it becomes diffused: it cannot, therefore, cut
any longer at the bottom; and for its former tendency
to directness of course is substituted a tendency
to meandering.</p>

<p>In Switzerland you read much of the past and
present life of this terraqueous globe. So indeed you
may on the alluvial flats of our eastern counties, if it
is there that your lot has been cast; but with this
difference, that in them the characters of the writing
are small and indistinct, while in Switzerland they are
in Roman text, and are held up before you, as it were
on a signboard, to attract your attention. The life
of the globe, like that of a plant or animal, is the result
of the forces that have acted, and are acting within it,
and upon it. In Switzerland you behold what was
their action in past times in the mighty mountains
they have upheaved; and in the stratification of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
mountains you behold what preceded their upheaval;
and then you go on of yourself to consider what
preceded the deposition of those strata. You are
reading nature backwards, as you might a Hebrew
volume. In the igneous rocks that you see have been
intruded you read another chapter that reveals to you
the action of other forces. The shivering of mountain
pinnacles tells you something about lightning, storms,
and frosts. Excavated valleys, and lakes, polished
rocks, and striated mountain flanks, and old <i>moraine</i>
mounds are a lesson to you upon glacier action, and
its greater activity in former epochs. Excised ravines,
filled-up lakes, avalanches of <i>débris</i>, mountainside
slips, burying villages and blocking up valleys, roads
you are traversing cut through, and bridges you were
to have crossed carried away, fields buried, or washed
away, or lately formed, are chapters on the action of
running water. Forests flourishing on all but naked
rock, greenest prairies on a soil but an inch or two
deep, earth-pillars, threads of water on every mountain
side, and a glancing stream in every valley, oblige you
to think of the relation of oceans, clouds, winds, the
varying capacity of the atmosphere for retaining
moisture, and of rain, to the vegetable and animal life
of the land. Fragments of mountains hurled into
valleys may remind you of earthquakes. And the
interest of all this is intensified by thinking how it has
shaped the life of man, and is at this moment, while
you are reading the lesson before you, affecting its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
every day. Manifestly it is these operations of nature
which have provided him with his station here, and
manifestly he must conform his life to the conditions
of the station he inhabits. It is so, of course, everywhere.
But here in Switzerland it is more readily
seen and felt that it is so.</p>

<p>On emerging from the ravine of the Via Mala the
transformation of scene has some resemblance to that
on the <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Gothard route, when one passes from the
Devil’s Bridge by a few steps through the Urner Loch
into the Urserenthal. In the case of the latter the
transformation is more sudden and complete. There
the change of form from pointed ruggedness to wavy
smoothness, and of colour from gray and black to soft
green is so instantaneous that the feeling produced is
almost that of being transferred in a moment from
darkness to light. Here the change, though complete,
is not instantaneous. You are prepared for the valley
of Schams, its fields, chiefly of green, but with some
gold, its villages, its churches, its scattered <i lang="fr">châlets</i>,
its busy inhabitants by a mile, or so, of intermediate
improvement. The scenes are not shifted, or reversed,
before you know what is being done, but one melts
into the other. It is a diorama in which the valley of
Schams takes the place of the ravine of the Via Mala.
Still, if you are at all susceptible to effects of this kind,
the change in the nature of the impressions will be
felt to be great. My feeling was that I was a musical
instrument possessed of consciousness, but not of free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
agency; and that nature was playing on me what,
and as, she pleased: first something rude, simple, and
clangorous; then something soft, soothing, and varied.</p>

<p>From Zillis, the first village of the valley, where
we stopped at the hotel de la Poste for half an hour,
I counted five villages over the grassy slopes around
me, and seven churches, generally on more or less
conspicuous knolls. I was seated outside in the sun
on a bench against the wall. The presence of a
stranger soon attracted the curiosity of some children
that were playing about in the street. A few cents
secured their attention. I asked them why they were
not at school. The schools here were not open, they
told me, except in winter. During the four months of
summer they are closed, in order that the children of
these industrious peasants may learn to labour, as well
as to read and write; and that the schoolmaster, too,
may have as well as other people, time to get in his
hay, or in some way or other to earn what will enable
him to buy hay, for in this part of the world none can
live without a cow.</p>

<p>And as it is with attendance at school, so is it to
a great extent in these valleys with attendance at
church: it is affected by times and seasons. I once
asked a woman who was describing to me the rigour
of the winter in one of these high valleys, whether she
was speaking from experience? Did she live up here
in winter? Of course she did. Where else had poor
people to go?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>‘What do you do to pass the time?’</p>

<p>‘In winter we go every day to church.’</p>

<p>‘Why do you not go every day now?’</p>

<p>‘Because we have now something else to do.’</p>

<p>The custom, then, of going to church, as I have
often suspected is the case with prayer three times a
day in the East, does not owe its existence and its
maintenance exclusively to motives of a religious kind.
It in some degree rests upon its giving people something
to do, who otherwise would at the time have
nothing to do, and upon its enabling them to indulge
their sense of gregariousness. There is nothing
mischievous, or reprehensible in this. Quite the contrary;
for why in our efforts to keep alive our sense
of the Unseen, and our moral sense, should we reject
what aid may be obtained from the action of motives
which, though not religious in the ordinary meaning
of the word, are quite natural and very beneficial?</p>

<p>I found that in this valley, as is the case in most
others, there are very few families who do not reside
in houses of their own, and very few owners of houses
who are without a bit of land of their own. This very
much increased the interest with which I regarded the
seven villages, and the multitude of little patches of
green, and of gold, which tesselated the area around
me of about a mile and a half in diameter, walled in
by its amphitheatre of rugged mountains. To live in
a house that is your own makes life pleasanter, and to
cultivate a field that is your own makes labour lighter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
The thoughts, the feelings, the lives of peasants who
live in their own houses, and cultivate their own land
are of a higher order than the thoughts, the feelings,
the lives of those who do not; and where this underlies
the picture, the scene is a pleasanter one to
contemplate.</p>

<p>Having loitered much by the way it was midday
when I entered Andeer. This is the chief place in
the valley. It possesses many roomy substantially
built houses, and is quite a little town. From its
extent you would suppose that its population must
exceed the 600 it is said to contain. All these towns,
however, cover more ground than towns of equal
population would with us from the fact that almost
all the dwelling houses have annexed to them cow-houses
with the hayloft in an upper story: and these
cow-houses with haylofts over them are not readily
distinguishable from dwelling houses. The hotel
Fravi, at which I put up—I do not know whether
there is another in the place—rehorses the diligences
and carriages, which go to and fro over the Splügen.
It is therefore a large establishment, making up many
beds, and having stabling for about forty horses. The
thickness of the walls of the hotel, nearly three feet
on the third story, reminded me of the severity of the
winter these 600 people have to get through, somehow
or other, with their scanty means and humble appliances,
when their houses are for months together half
buried in snow, and they are walled in, as it were in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
prison, with mountain-high snow barriers right and
left, and every breath of air that reaches them is
charged with most benumbing cold.</p>

<p>On this day, however, there was nothing to suggest
the severities of an Alpine winter, except the preparations
these good people were making for its advent.
The depth of colour in the blue abyss, unflecked by
cloud, and undimmed by a suspicion of mistiness, was
such as we can know little of here in England. It
was one of a succession of sunny days, that was following
a spell of wet; and so every man, woman, and
child was out making, or bringing in, hay. The
shutters of almost every house in the town were up,
indicating where their inmates were, and what they
were about. Later in the day the results of the work
of the day, and of the few fine ones that had preceded
it, began to be seen in the streets. There was a constant
succession of little trucks drawn by oxen, some
on wheels, and some on runners, loaded high with
fragrant hay. Those who could not afford oxen drew
these trucks themselves, the mother and the little
people often pulling it along together; and, to go a
step still lower, those who could not afford the trucks,
carried their hay in large bundles on their own backs.
The sun was at the bottom of all this life and successful
labour; and the warmth he was pouring down into
the valley to-day would keep these industrious families
alive in the winter. The amount of air, too, was just
what was enough for their haymaking. To one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
sitting outside the hotel, close by its row of poplars,
watching the arrival of the hay harvest, the breeze
appealed to four senses at once. You felt the contact
of its crisp freshness; you heard the rustling, and saw
the quivering of the aspen leaves as it moved by
them; and it brought to you the fragrance of the new
hay. Later in the day when the hay was housed, and
the fields were wet with dew, you heard the blacksmith’s
hammer repairing the damages the good
people’s tools had sustained, and the wood-cleaver’s
axe preparing to-morrow’s fuel. For in this part of
the world all trades work till 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, having begun at
5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>; two hours in the middle of the day being
appropriated to rest—two sacred hours, the sabbath of
each day—which are most religiously observed everywhere,
even at the post-office bureau. And these men
who were now working on till eight, had been at work
all day in the hay-field, from which they had only
been driven by the heavy dew of such an evening,
following such a day, at such a height.</p>

<p><i>August 8.</i>—By the stratagem of inviting the circumnavigator
to breakfast with me this morning at
4.40 was enabled to get off at five. As we passed down
the main street of the little town—the hotel Fravi is
at its northern end—I again heard, as I had up to
eight yesterday evening, the blacksmith’s hammer and
the wood-river’s axe; for there was at this early hour
too much dew on the grass for their hay-making. If,
as the monkish saying tells us, to labour is to pray,
then the life of these poor peasants, at all events in
summer, is both continuous and earnest prayer.
It is prayer in deed, in support of the prayer in word
of their long winters, about which we were told something
in the last chapter. Their prayer in deed must
have a good moral effect upon them, for it is doing
their utmost under such conditions as oblige them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
feel that the success of their efforts will after all depend
on unseen causes over which they have no direct control.
It is also through a dumb, yet still a most
eloquent appeal to those unseen causes.</p>

<p>Above Andeer our valley, which is now approaching
the Splügen, begins to close in. The Splügen,
however, was not my destination. The aspect of
things in, as we are told, the highest inhabited valley
in Europe, and a glimpse of the life of its inhabitants,
had more attraction for me; and so my route to-day
was to be up the Aversthal, debouching, whenever the
time might come for that, at Casaccia at the foot of
the Maloja, on the road from Chievenna to the
Engadin. My plan was to get as far as I conveniently
could in the first half of the day, and to spend the remainder
of it in looking at whatever there might be
to see at whatever place I might then have reached.
I did not expect much encouragement in my efforts
to push on from my companion. Still I would not
begin by anticipating difficulties and disappointments:
at all events I had yesterday given him very little to
do, and plenty of time to rest; and some of that little
to do he had shuffled off by entrusting my <i>sac</i> to a
return carriage, and some of that plenty of time for
rest he had turned to account by sleeping through the
greater part of the afternoon in an empty diligence in
the coach-house of the hotel. At about two miles
above Andeer the stream of the Aversthal falls into
that of the Hinter Rhein. Immediately beyond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
point of junction the path for the Aversthal starts
from the right bank of the Hinter Rhein, and takes
the left bank of the Averser Bach. There is no mistaking
it, for at first, and for some two or three miles
up the valley, as far as an abandoned smelting-house,
it is an old cart track. After this it becomes a horse
path. In some places between the binonymous
hamlet of Inner Ferrera or Canicül and Campsut it
has of late been so damaged as to be for the present
available for pedestrians only. But these good people
have so much of the wisdom of the ant and of the bee
in repairing damages, that we may be sure that the
road will soon again be made practicable for horse
traffic.</p>

<p>As this is undeservedly a not much frequented
way, I will give some particulars of it. It begins in a
pine wood with the Averser Bach, or Averser Rhein
as it is more grandiloquently sometimes styled,
blustering by on your left over its rocky bed in no
inconsiderable volume. After a time you cross to its
opposite bank. The stream has now, in correspondence
with the increasing grade of the ascent, become more
rapid and noisy. The rocks, too, over which it
tumbles having become larger—some of them are
large tables of rock—give occasion for several small
waterfalls. There are lofty mountains by the side of
your path, and others still loftier are at times visible
in the distance. Sometimes your path lies over the
outspread rock-fragments brought down the mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
side by storm torrents. You see that it would be
bad to be caught here while such work was going on,
for you would have but little chance of keeping your
feet against the descending stream of commingled
rocks and water. After this the valley widens into
prairies, upon which are a few <i lang="fr">châlets</i>. This is the
village of Ausser Ferrera. Beyond this the path, still
on the right bank, takes you through a stretch of pine
wood, which again terminates in prairies. This time
the expanse is larger; and here is Inner Ferrera, or
Canicül. You now have to recross to the left bank,
and to ascend through a pine wood, which continues
as far as Campsut. Along this part of the way the
scene is often grandly hard and rugged. The near
and distant mountains are mighty masses. The iron-faced
precipices awe you. The stream is impatient to
get away from them. At about a third of this stage
of the way we had to cross, not much above the
stream, some steep inclines of freshly brought down
mountain rubbish, which had in some places buried,
in others carried away, the path. This brought us
down quite to the level of the stream, where its course
describes a curve round the end of a lofty precipitous
mountain. We were on the inner side of the curve.
Here nature had given no space for a path, and so it
had to be formed partly by excavation, and partly by
the construction of a narrow wooden roadway supported
on king-posts and struts, just out of the reach
of floods. On the opposite side of the Bach, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
precipitous face of the mountain wall, which formed
the outer side of the curve of the stream here described,
was a deep ravine: to form it the mountain wall had
been as it were split in two, or rent asunder. Through
this ravine poured the Starlera Bach. As soon as we
had rounded the curve, being still not many yards
distant from the Starlera ravine and its torrent, we
came on a corresponding ravine and torrent on our
side—those of the Val de Lei. We crossed them by a
wooden bridge. Beyond the bridge is a little level
space of three or four yards square. Standing here
the scene was singularly impressive. The only sound
was that of the three torrents rushing together. The
only sight that of the three deep, steep, ravines they
were rushing down, each torrent between two lofty
precipitous mountains. Three troubled streams, and
six iron-faced lines of mountain precipices, and the
little space of unfathomable blue above: these were all.
Had I been alone, or had there been with me one who
possessed an inner sense capable of being touched by
such a scene, I would gladly have loitered at this
point for some little time. The feeling that came
over me was that which the desert engenders—that
you have intruded on a scene not meant for man.
There it is stillness, desolateness, absence of life; here
it is mountains closing in around you, and torrents
blustering by, and no place for anything else, that
warn you off. The iron-faced precipices will advance
a little closer, the torrents will rise a little higher, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
resent your intrusion. I wished to surrender myself
for a little time to the impressions of the moment, to
commune a little with the <i lang="la">genius loci</i>. As it was, I
was hurried through this home of the spirit of the
Brocken, and still wonder the monster did not show
himself, to make me understand that that was no
place for such feeble creatures as the children of men.</p>

<p>Beyond this point we found that the road had
again been carried away. A straight-sided gully had
lately been cut through it to the depth of about eight
feet. Four men were here at work making a cutting
for the road down to the bottom of the newly-formed
gully. In such a place it would have been of no use
to refill the excavation, because the incoherent
material used for this purpose would be carried away
by the next rain. They had instead of this sunk the
road to the bottom of the gully on the lower side.
Up the perpendicular eight feet of the upper face,
which they had not yet begun to make practicable,
we had to climb by the aid of a few projecting roots.
If our hold of the roots, or the roots’ hold of the soil,
had failed—of course there was but slight chance of
either of these possibilities occurring—we should have
tumbled down about sixty feet into the Bach, for as
the road was along the edge of a precipice, a fall from
the face of the gully would have been a fall down the
precipice also.</p>

<p>The path now in good repair, and on the descent,
continued through pine woods, and in about an hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
conducted us to an open grassy space, where we
crossed the stream to the right bank. Here was the
village of Campsut. We were now at an elevation of
5,000 feet, where nothing could be grown but grass.
As we were entering the village, a little girl, of about
ten years of age, a rosy <i>brunette</i>, who was running to
join her friends in the hay-fields, almost came into
collision with us. She was so confounded by this
sudden rencontre with strangers, that for some little
time she was unable to answer our questions. When
we released her, she started off again like a wild
animal that had been suddenly disturbed by a more
than doubtful apparition. At the further end of Campsut
we got a rare draught of milk. It was presented
to us in a little circular wooden tub with two small
handles formed by the projection of two of the staves.
This milk was deliciously fresh and rich; and as to
the little wooden tub, that was so spotlessly clean
that it was a pleasure to look at it. The dame to
whom we were indebted for this draught was above
the common height, and, like the little girl, had remarkably
good features, and a ruddy brown complexion.
Hard work, rough weather, long winters, and
simple fare, had had as yet their issue only in health
and strength. I tarried over the tub of delicious milk,
not only for its sake. A little talk with such a donor
of such a draught was a pleasant interlude. The order
and cleanliness of everything in the <i lang="fr">châlet</i> showed that
she had such ambition as Campsut admitted of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>Beyond Campsut a charming bit of smooth turf
interspersed with large rocks, and detached larches,
some little height above the brawling stream, with
grand mountains right and left, and still grander
mountains in front, brought us to Crot—a village of a
few scattered <i lang="fr">châlets</i>. You have to descend to the
stream. Before you lies the sombre green, treeless
Madriserthal, to be entered after crossing the stream
by a bridge. Our way, however, was not across the
stream up the Madriserthal; so just beyond Crot,
having crossed the Bach of our own valley, we turned
away from the Madriserthal, and ascended a steep,
grassy slope on our left. This after a time became
rocky, with, among the rocks, larches and cembras.
Having reached the summit of this rise, with our
Bach on our left, we advanced for some way, along
the flank of the mountain, through an ancient open
forest, and then crossed the stream, now in a ravine,
by the second of two bridges, about a mile from
Cresta. On the Cresta side of the ravine is no wood:
at first only very rocky alpe, and then, when the
village is reached, upland prairie. At about half a
mile from the village we met a chubby little urchin of
about ten years of age, with head and feet bare, clad
in strong thick homespun of hemp and coarse woollen.
He came up to us with an easy self-possessed air,
knowing very well what we wanted, and announced
that he was the son of the <i>Pasteur</i>, and would
conduct us to his father’s house, which is for travellers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
the recognized inn of the place, as he is their recognized
host.</p>

<p>It had been part of my Machiavelism for this day
to take with us nothing to eat, in order to ensure our
getting at all events as far as Cresta. The stratagem
had been quite successful, for having stopped nowhere
by the way, except for the tub of milk at Campsut,
we reached Cresta at 11.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> And fortunate it
was that we had started early, the result of the other
successful little ruse I have already mentioned, and
had had no delays on the road, for we had not been
at Cresta half-an-hour when it began to rain, the rain
being diversified only with snow for twenty-two
hours.</p>

<p>During the afternoon there was no going outside
the door. But there was enough within for an afternoon.
First there was the <i>Pasteur</i> himself, a well-built
man of about forty years of age. He wore
coloured clothes, in which it was clear that he did much
out o’door work. This, from the situation of Cresta,
must have been restricted to cutting, fetching, and
riving wood for fuel, and making hay. On Sundays,
of course, his working clothes are exchanged for the
clerical black and white, with the portentous collar and
bands of the Swiss Reformed Church. He kept himself
no cows, only goats. The goats, however, would require
hay, and he could assist his neighbours, too, in
making their hay. Cow’s milk, I suppose, can always
be bought in such a place, where the number of cows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
must be great in proportion to that of the villagers.
He spoke German, French, and Romansch, and was a
man of observation, thought, and intelligence. He is
also the schoolmaster of the Commune, which is that of
Oberland Aversthal, which reaches from Crot to Juf,
a place some way above Cresta. His pastoral duties,
I understood, extended down the valley below Crot
as far as Inner Ferrera, or Canicül. To these employments
must be added, as I have already mentioned,
that of entertaining such travellers as would prefer
what he has to offer to what they would find at the
little village inn.</p>

<p>The good man’s wife was not now visible. She
had for some months been suffering from a serious
illness, and had not yet seen a medical man; nor,
whatever turn her illness might take, was there much
chance of her seeing one, because it would require
two days for one to come and return, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Moritz in
the Engadin being the nearest point from which
assistance of this kind could be had. Here, therefore,
medical advice and medicines can only be received
through the post. The poor woman’s illness threw
much of the work of the house upon him, in which,
however, he was aided by a sturdy Romansch-speaking
damsel.</p>

<p>Then there was the view from the window. This,
from a height above the stream of about 500 feet,
commanded the valley and the opposite range.
The lower half of this range was covered with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
open forest of cembra, a part of which we had passed
through in the forenoon. Above the forest was
Alpine pasture. All along the ridge the line that
divided the forest from the pasture was perfectly
straight: nowhere did the forest encroach on the
grass, or the grass on the forest. On entering the
forest above Crot we had seen some larch, but there
was none, I believe, opposite to Cresta, nothing but
cembra. Nor were there any young trees in the
forest, though the old ones stood at such a distance
from each other as to give sufficient pasturage for a
herd of cows I could just make out as I stood at the
window. I could also make out with a glass a flock
of goats in the forest, and that accounted to me for
the absence of young trees. I had often observed
that the goat cannot kill the young spruce, of which the
forests generally consist. Of course they bite off the
new terminals of the leader, and of the laterals, but not
quite to the bottom of the new wood. The terminals,
therefore, of the laterals, though bitten back every year,
still gain an inch or two every year; and as this makes
the plant grow into a very compact and bushy form,
the time comes when the goat can no longer reach
over the compact mass of laterals to bite off the terminal
of the leader. That was only to be got at so
long as its enemy could reach over to it. Every year
the enemy is forced back a little; and so in a dozen
or twenty years it is no longer able to reach it. The
terminal of the leader then advances in safety, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
tree is quickly formed. All that has happened is,
that it was delayed some years in making its start.
But during this period of delay the roots were
spreading far, and establishing themselves with a
good hold of the ground; when, therefore, the start
at last is made, the growth is very rapid. You may
always distinguish the trees that had in their early
days been kept back for a time in this way, for the
lower part of their trunks, the three or four feet
nearest the ground, are always crooked. This indicates
how they had been maltreated by the goats.
So it is with the ordinary pine of the Swiss forests. Of
the cembras, however, I observed that they could not
escape the goats in this way, or in any way; either
because the bite of these animals is at once destructive
to them, or because having been bitten back they have
not the power of forming a compact bush, and so of
rising eventually out of harm’s way. At all events
the goats kill the young trees of this species; and this
will account for so many forests of cembra having
died out, or now being in process of dying out. One
would suppose that this cause of their destruction would
be guarded against in these lofty Grison valleys, some
of which are rendered habitable only by the supply of
wood furnished by what remains of ancient forests of
this species, which is the only Swiss conifer that grows
at such heights. But in this valley of Oberland
Aversthal there is some peat; its inhabitants, therefore,
are not entirely dependent for fuel on their single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
forest of cembra opposite to Cresta. Their dependence,
however, upon it for material for the construction
of their houses is complete. When, therefore, their
one forest shall have been consumed they must either
take to building with stone, or abandon the valley as
a place of residence.</p>

<p>It was interesting to watch the effects of the snow
storms, which throughout this afternoon alternated
with showers of rain, and will continue to do so till
10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to-morrow. On our side of the valley, which,
as it faced the south, had been heated by the sun of
the forenoon and of yesterday, the snow never lay on
the ground. On the opposite side every fall of snow
completely whitened the Alpine pasture above the
forest, but rarely extended any way down into the
forest; and on the few occasions when it did was
very soon gone. When we left the place the following
day all the pasture above the forest was white, but
the turf between the trees was free from snow. Of
course the ground beneath the trees is somewhat
warmer than in the open, as every animal knows
when it chooses its night’s resting-place; still the
visible difference between the two suggested the
questions of whether there is not what may be roughly
regarded as a line for the snow that falls in summer,
and whether it is this supposed line of summer-falling
snow which defines the upper limit of the forest by
preventing above that limit the germination of seeds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
or by killing the young plants in the tender stage of
their first growth.</p>

<p>Of course there was a great deal of talk with our
host. He was, naturally enough, glad to have some
one to talk to—a feeling which his guest, as might be
supposed, was ready to reciprocate. This was his
second year at Cresta. This year, up to the date of
my visit, several Germans, and two Americans, had
stopped for a night at his house, but not one Englishman.
His continuance in his present position depended
in equal degrees on his parishioners’ good
pleasure and on his own choice. The liberty of the
two contracting parties was equal. They could bid
him go, if so minded; and he, if so minded, could
bid them look out for another <i>Pasteur</i>. Romansch
he thought was dying out in the neighbourhood,
being hard pressed by German on the north and to
some extent by Italian on the south. As respects
the schools there was a general leaning towards having
German taught in them, on account of its superior
utility for business purposes, even in places where
the religious instruction is still given in Romansch.</p>

<p>The school of Oberland Aversthal is held in his
house. A large room on the ground-floor has been
fitted up for this purpose. Considering how poor the
peasants are, I was surprised at the excellence of the
fittings. The room had double windows, and an
excellent stove, which was of such dimensions that I
was at a loss to imagine how it could have ever been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
brought up the valley. There were good desks and
benches, master’s desk and blackboard. In short, the
apparatus was as good as could be wished. All this
is accounted for by remembering that, though it is
provided by the peasants, it is provided for their own
children. Every family in the valley has a strong
personal interest in the school; and this concentration
of personal interest upon the school-room issues in its
being the best furnished room in the commune. And
as the minister is the master, we may suppose that the
teaching and tone of the school is correspondingly
good. Of course here, as elsewhere in these parts,
the school is open only during the winter months,
which, however, at an altitude of 6,400 feet, that of
the schoolroom—Juf is some hundreds of feet higher—must
comprise nine months of the year.</p>

<p>Off the schoolroom was the guests’ chamber, whose
wants had been taken into account in the construction
of the house. In this everything was brightly clean.
It contained two beds, and about a dozen volumes in
German. Behind these two rooms was the hall, or
store-room, of the house. Above the school-room
was the sitting-room. On either side of this was a
bed-room. Behind these were some small rooms, in
one of which my porter was berthed.</p>

<p>The Canton had been desirous that a road should
be constructed through the valley to connect either
the Upper Engadin, or Casaccia, below the Maloja,
with the Splügen road; and with a view to this the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
preliminary surveys had been made. The proposal,
however, was so distasteful to the peasants, that it
had been withdrawn for the present. This reminded
one of the opposition that was made to the Great
Western Railway by the authorities of a famous
University; an opposition which has left its mark on
the railway map of England, for it diverted the
railway from its intended course, both to the cost of
the shareholders and to the inconvenience of the
University. The unlettered ignorance of the peasants
of Oberland Aversthal has come to the same conclusion
as did the learned Doctors of Oxford. They
both alike argued, we are no part of the world; the
world is wicked, and will invade us; we are no match
for the world. Fortunately not. The result in the
case of Overland Aversthal will be what it was in the
case of the famous University. The wicked world
will in the end have its way, and the opponents of the
wicked world will come to acknowledge that it is not
a bad way, and that they are none the worse for
accommodating themselves to it: in fact, that they
are themselves a part of the world, and cannot do
without it.</p>

<p>One little matter I noticed this morning cannot
but work in the direction of opening the eyes of these
naturally conservative peasants to their true interests.
Some time after we had entered the valley—it was at
about 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>—we met a walking postman with a
bulky bag on his back. There was much in that bag.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
It contained the wants, the hopes, the schemes, the
feelings of Unterland and Oberland Aversthal. At
about the corresponding hour in the evening, as I
was looking from the <i>Pasteur’s</i> window at the aspect
of things in the rain, I saw the same man arrive on
his return journey. He had on his back the same
bag. In it he had now brought back the reciprocation
of that terrible outside world to the wants, hopes,
schemes, and feelings of the valley. All this only
means that these good people have dealings with,
and friends in, that terrible world, dealings without
which they could not possibly exist, and friends who
are very dear to them, and affection for whom
constitutes a large ingredient of their inner life.
Every family must every year sell a cow, and a young
bullock or two, and so much cheese, to buy coffee, and
brandy, and scythes, and many other things it cannot
do without; and arrangements for these sales and
purchases are made through the post; and every
family may have a relative seeking a livelihood in the
outside world, some far enough off in it, and it does
them good to hear of that relative’s welfare. Well, if
it is desirable that these transactions, and this intelligence,
should be facilitated by the walking postman,
would it not be desirable that they should be
still further facilitated by a good road? It would,
practically, enhance the price they would get for their
young bullocks, and surplus cows and cheese, and
lessen the price of the coffee, the brandy, the scythes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
and their other necessary purchases. It would, too,
increase the value of every <i>klafter</i> of land in the
valley. And it would bring many travellers into the
valley, in catering for whom some money might be
made. Some of them would get a better living, than
any of them get now, by acting as guides and porters.
They would see more of the world, and the world
would see more of them; and just as the world would
be the better for knowing something of Aversthal, so
would its good people be the better for knowing
something of the world. No one of them would now
wish to go back to the ante-post times. The silent,
but inevitable action of the post will lead on to the
road; and then no one will wish to go back to the
ante-road times.</p>

<p>But the above-mentioned bag, full of such beneficent
magic, for it was magic that disclosed to every
family what their hearts were yearning to know, and
what their business required, was not on this afternoon
the whole of the walking postman’s load.
There was also on his back an osier basket for our
host. He had made preparations for its reception;
but the chubby little fellow, who had conducted us to
his father’s house, was the first to announce its
arrival. He and his father were soon out in the rain,
opening it carefully so as not either to injure the
basket, or rudely to shake its contents, I should have
said its inmates, for on raising the lid there were
revealed to their delighted eyes three geese—three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
live geese. A little enclosure had been got ready for
them, to which they were forthwith transferred, the
good man carrying two, and the chubby little fellow
the third. They already had half-a-dozen chickens:
the only ones I saw in the village, or, indeed, in the
valley. This, then, was a great and interesting addition
to the live stock of Oberland Aversthal; though
now, on recalling the conditions of the place, I cannot
imagine how they were to be kept through the winter,
or, indeed, how they were to be kept at any time out
of harm’s way: for they needs must sooner or later
get down to the Bach, from which there would not be
much chance of their coming back alive, as they
would probably, in their first attempt to navigate it,
be dashed to death against the rocks. But whatever
might be the issue of the experiment, the good
opinion of our host I was already disposed to form
was further strengthened on my finding that he was
fond of tending animals. It was, too, an experiment
that might, I wish I could say must, add to the companions
and the resources—there is a little jar in that
word resources—of his neighbours, whose lives up
here above the clouds are somewhat wanting in
objects of ordinary earthly interest.</p>

<p>The Romansch-speaking damsel was setting the
table for supper at the time when this new form of
animal life arrived at Cresta. The <i>Pasteur’s</i> half
dozen fowls hearing the stir outside came forth from
the shed, in which they had taken refuge from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
rain, to see what it was all about. They were of a
small breed, for it costs too much to keep large fowls
in a place where their maize has to be brought a
day’s journey on a man’s back. I chipped off a few
crumbs from a roll that had just been placed on the
table—they were detached with difficulty—and threw
them down from the window. The proud little cock—it
was a proceeding we must all many a time have
observed—took a piece up with his beak, but instead
of swallowing it—what self-restraint! summoned his
seraglio for the delicious morsels, depositing before
the first arrival the one that was in his beak. That
surely, the thought flashed upon me—for at Cresta
one sees things in a new light—is not instinct; or if
it is, then the ordinary definition of instinct ought to
be somewhat enlarged. It is self-denial, politeness,
policy, gratitude, affection. Whether it looks to the
past, or to the future, there is something wonderfully
human about it. It is true that all chanticleers do
this; but if they do not understand now, which is
what I do not believe, then their progenitors must
have once understood, so this supposition only removes
the fact some steps back, that under the conditions
of their position, that is under the relations
in which they were standing to their seraglios, it was
the right thing to do. The conditions and relations
of the position must have been understood, and what
under them was profitable and becoming must have
been seen. Either then, for that is our conclusion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
reason is less mechanical in them, or else more mechanical
in ourselves, than is generally supposed; or,
to put it in another way, their reason and ours are
more closely akin than is generally supposed.</p>

<p>But the arrival of the geese by the post carries us
back to our argument that the post is a preparation
for the at present much dreaded road. Will not
these good people some day come to see that if it is
advantageous to have a path that admits of the postman
bringing to them three geese in a basket, and
other such things, that it would be more advantageous
to have a road that would admit of the diligence
post, or the carrier’s cart, bringing them many
other things they want, but which are beyond the
carrying power of the postman? This is a question
we may be sure will occur to them, and be discussed,
in their long winters; and, too, we may be sure that
the young people, who will have been brought up by
the minister in the well-appointed school the old
people are maintaining, will upon this subject for the
most part be of a different way of thinking from the
old people.</p>

<p>As to the supper, (the preparations for which
supplied us with those crumbs, the grateful, or judicious,
appropriation of which made us wish to improve
our knowledge of what we call instinct,) it was
the same as our dinner had been with the addition of
butter, and the substitution of coffee for Valtelline
wine. The meat was again the mummy beef with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
which I had first become acquainted at Peist. To
this was now added mummy ham. The bread had
been baked at Silva Plana in the Engadin, and was a
month old. It was the petrified fossil of bread. No
traces of moisture remained in it, and it was as hard
to masticate as it had been to cut. Those who know
what are the habits of Swiss swine in summer, when
kept on the mountains about the <i lang="fr">châlets</i> where the
cows pass the night, will not be able to bring themselves
to touch pig in any form in Switzerland. As
therefore I was obliged to reject the mummy ham,
and had not yet discovered the merits of mummy
beef, I dined on bread and cheese and wine, and
supped on bread and cheese and coffee. Not so,
however, the circumnavigator. At dinner I had been
somewhat shocked at the vigour of his appetite, for
he left nothing on the table; and now at supper,
seeing that the same process was being repeated, and
knowing how hard those comestibles had been to
come at in this part of the world, and seeing also
that the good <i>Pasteur</i> had set before us what he must
have supposed would have left a large margin for
discretion, I rose from the table in a way to intimate
to my companion that I thought it time for him to
do the same. He would not, however, take the hint.
I, therefore, reminded him that these things were hard
to come by up here, and that I had no doubt but
that they were in consequence used frugally, and
wound up my little speech with the dictum that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
enough was better than too much. My facts, however,
reflections, and platitudes had no other effect
than that of extracting from my voracious attendant
the remark, that he always began to suspect that he
was not all right when he found that he could not
feed well. I could not help retorting, ‘Then just
now you must have the satisfaction of feeling that
you are unusually well.’ But this, like what had preceded
it, glanced off from his thick skin, for he continued
doggedly at work, till there was not left on
the table a crumb of anything, of beef, ham, cheese,
butter, sugar, or bread, wherefrom to draw any further
sanitary inferences. I now poured out on him the
last dregs of my disgust by telling him that it was
fortunate for him that he had not to live up here, for
if so he would have few opportunities through life for
ascertaining the state of his health. It would have
had a pleasant flavour of revenge, if I could have
made him pay his own shot for this supper; but
from that he knew that he was safe, because if for
any reason—my reason in this case was the wish to
save our host some trouble—you bid your man take
his meals with you, you must of course pay for both.</p>

<p>Besides his experiment in live stock, the good
man was making one in gardening. He had enclosed
a little space, about half-a-dozen yards square, facing
to the south, and had sown in it white beet, the leaf-stalks
of which are eaten, cabbages, turnips, and
lettuce. This was his first summer at Cresta, and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
he had lost no time in endeavouring to ascertain how
far the sun could help him in this matter. But on
this, the 8th day of August, the prospect of success
was far from encouraging. The turnips showed no
tuberous tendencies, and had formed each but a few
small leaves. The foliage of the cabbages and
lettuces was in much the same condition. The
peculiarities of growth in those plants could still be
known to his neighbours only by what they might
have seen in that much dreaded outside world. A
little might be expected from the white-stalked beet;
but as there was only a fortnight more for the continuance
of the experiment, and it was even then
snowing, I cannot think that it will be repeated next
year. Or if so, it will not be for the sake of any contributions
the little garden may be expected to make
to the <i>Pasteur’s</i> table, but for the sake of his recollections
of the world below to which he once belonged.
The thought, however, crossed my mind
that this little garden had been made not so much
as an experiment, but in the hope of pleasing his
sick wife by exhibiting to her its products.</p>

<p>The fact is that nothing can be grown here but
grass, for Cresta is some way beyond the last cembra
on its side of the valley; and if one of these highest-climbing
of Swiss conifers could be coaxed into living
on such a spot—I saw a stunted oldish-looking dwarf
of the kind in the lower part of the village—it would
require a century to overtop the <i lang="fr">châlets</i>. No human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
food, therefore, can be produced except what is supplied
by the goats and cows. Here everything is transmuted
grass. No tribe of wandering Tartars ever lived
so exclusively on their flocks and herds. Not a potato,
not a stem of hemp, can be grown. Nature has been
far more bountiful to the most hard pressed Kirgishes.
Their steppes are a Paradise of fertility and variety
compared to Cresta. Indeed we must go somewhere
near the Arctic zone to find a parallel to its climate;
and even that will not do, for Iceland will not give it,
because there a few turnips and potatoes, of the size
of walnuts, may be grown. For what we are in search
of we must go beyond Iceland, and enter the arctic
circle, and perhaps at last the latitude that presents
an equivalent to its altitude may be found in Lapland.</p>

<p>What a life does this imply! What a weary
winter! What dreary confinement to the small comfortless
house, with the snow piled up to the windows
of the first floor, month after month! How must
the returning warmth of the sun, and the first glimpses
of the green grass be hailed! How must every hour
of the few days of their little summer be prized! In
that brief space they have to provision the garrison of
each home for the ensuing nine months. Their chief
care is for their hay, the one store upon which ultimately
the lives of all, both man and beast, depend.
We may be sure they do not lose an hour of daylight.
It is fortunate they cannot cut their grass by moonlight.
If they could, there would be some probability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
of their working themselves to death. They could
not cut it by moonlight, because, though thick enough
on the ground, much of it is only a few inches long—not
longer than what I have often seen the mowers
leaving behind them in English meadows. You see
no waste of that kind here, for these careful people
mow very smooth, and very near the ground. And
then they know that their few days of possible summer
are always more or less abridged by summer snow-storms.
How then must they be rejoiced in their
hearts when two or three bright, breezy days come
together, and enable them to get up what had been
previously cut! How heavily are they weighted in
the race they have to run for their lives against time!</p>

<p>Where the cow, a little aided by the goat, is the
one great means of support, the humblest family
cannot exist with less than five or six. They ought,
indeed, to have not less than seven. Milk and cheese
are their mainstay, with on high days and holidays a
shred or two of mummy beef, or pork. Everything
else they eat, or drink, or that they clothe themselves
with, or use in any way, must come indirectly from
the same source; that is to say, every family must
every year sell one cow (the price last year was twenty
napoleons), and a young bullock or two, and what
cheese they can spare, to purchase with the proceeds
rye or maize flour, potatoes, brandy, coffee, hemp,
wool, tools, and whatever else they may require.
Even the few pigs they keep can be turned to some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
account only by the aid of the cow. No kind of grain,
or of roots, can be had for this purpose. When summer,
therefore, has come, piggy must follow the cow up
into the high pasture, where the cheese is to be made.
The whey, that will be expressed from the curd, will
be his share. Upon this he will thrive moderately.
When he will descend from the mountains with some
little weight of flesh upon him, he will be taking his
last walk. He is about to pass into the mummy
condition. But how will those that are to be retained
for stock be kept during the winter? For several
months there will be nothing for them to graze upon,
and not one mouthful of anything convertible into
human food will be available for them. Every
pedestrian in Switzerland will have observed in front
of the mountain cheese <i lang="fr">châlets</i>, where the cows have
for generations passed their summer nights, and often,
too, by the side of the cow-houses in the villages, beds
of a large-leafed Alpine dock. Where the accumulations
of centuries from the cows have made the soil
too fat and greasy for grass, this plant luxuriates. It
delights in rankness. It also affects moist places, as
does in this country its congener, the water dock.
The leaves, and leaf-stalks of this dock, these careful
people collect in summer, and having scalded them,
seasoned with a sprinkling of salt, nettle-tops are
sometimes added, the mess is tubbed or barrelled, for
the winter. This is the pig’s winter food; his sour
krout. His daily meal of it is served to him warm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
That the Swiss pigs have to ascend and descend the
mountains together with the cows accounts for their
form. They are large-framed, and clean-limbed; they
have a long back, and long, bony legs. If built at all
like our pigs, they would be unable to do their long
journeys, and their climbing. In colour they are
generally more or less, sometimes entirely, of a rusty
chesnut.</p>

<p>There had, then, been much to do, and there had
not been much time for doing it. There was the
wood for fuel and for repairs that had been felled in
the previous winter, and that had to be brought in
before the hay was made. And there was the turf,
too, that had to be stored; and that also had been
dug before the hay was made, that every hour of
sunshine might be utilized for drying it, and for
making the hay—the precious hay, to which everything
must be subordinated, for upon it everything
depends. And that, too, after many delays and
anxieties, has at last been won, and is now safe under
cover. The whey-fed old sow, or the full-grown hog
in about the condition they would be with us when
put up to fatten, and the old cow now past milk, have
returned home for desiccation. The cows, whose day
is not yet done, are being comfortably housed. The
rye and maize flour, the potatoes, the brandy, the
coffee, the hemp and wool for the women to spin and
weave, are all being provided as expeditiously as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
possible. But time is running these preparations hard,
even if it does not show a-head of them, for the snow
has already fallen so deep that the ground will be no
more seen by the peasants of Ober Aversthal till next
year. The long dreadful winter is again upon them.</p>

<p><i>August 9.</i>—Up at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, but nothing could be
done out o’ doors. The only difference from yesterday
afternoon was that the amount of the rain had diminished
while that of the snow and sleet had increased.
The downfall of one or other was incessant. Such is
Cresta in the dog days. The good man of the house,
however, was of opinion—the circumnavigator did not
present himself and his opinion till past seven—that
the weather would improve before midday. At ten
his prognostications were verified, and we started for
Casaccia by way of the Forcellina and the Septimer.
Every one yesterday, and this morning, recommended
us to go to the Engadin by the way of Stalla on the
Julier, as the shorter and easier route. But as I was
not due till midday to-morrow at Pontresina, where I
was to meet my wife, and the little boy of my two
former <i>Months in Switzerland</i>, there was plenty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
time, if only the weather would permit, for the grander
Pass of the Forcellina, the old paved road of the Septimer,
and the Maloja, all of which I wished to see;
the shortness, therefore, and easiness of the alternative
route were only deterrent considerations.</p>

<p>The valley immediately beyond Cresta begins to
widen and flatten its bottom prairie land. We
walked over the grass rejoicing in the returning
gleams of sunshine; and all the more because we
knew how deeply every soul around us was stirred by
the same feelings, for did not those warm rays of
light mean well-being for their families during the
long arctic winter that was already not far off?
These first gleams, however, were shockingly short-lived,
for before we had reached Pürt, the first
village beyond Cresta, the sleet had again returned,
and we were driven to take refuge in a large hay-grange,
which it was pleasant to find nearly full of
new hay. Upon this we sat for some twenty minutes,
noting, through the open door, the women of the
place scouring their wooden milk vessels, and setting
their small white meagre cheeses on the window sills
to consolidate. Each piece was about the shape, size,
and colour of a marmalade gallipot. The sleet
having nearly exhausted itself, a second start was made.
As we went along we counted a herd of about fifty
cows on the lower flank of the opposite range. Among
them was a large flock of crows; on our side we saw a
pair of hawks, and a pair of choughs. The feathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
fauna of the Grisons is to the eye of the pedestrian
far more abundant both in species and in individuals
than that of Central, or of Western Switzerland. We
passed through two more villages, and as many more
scuds of sleet, and at midday reached Juf, the last
village of Oberland Aversthal, and the highest village
in Europe that is inhabited throughout the year.</p>

<p>Here it was necessary that we should halt for
dinner. Designedly I had taken nothing with us, in
order that we might be thrown entirely on the resources
of people who live at an elevation of 6,900
feet, that is to say 500 feet above Cresta. The
<i lang="fr">châlet</i> we chanced to enter was that of the shoemaker
of Juf. At first we found in it only an ancient dame.
Before, however, we left we had to receive a levée of
some ten, or a dozen of the inhabitants of the place.
The ancient dame would gladly do for us anything
in her power. Milk, of course, she could supply; but
she insisted on our having it warm: for who ever offered
any one cold milk when sleet was falling? For this it
was necessary that a fire should be lighted. She also
had some black rye-bread, and two kinds of cheese:
a piece of last year’s fat cheese, and plenty of this
year’s meagre cheese. This was all. I, however,
was quite satisfied. Was it not the best these good
people had to offer? and was it not what they had
themselves to be satisfied with? The sitting-room
was very low—hardly more than six feet in height.
This was, first, to economize the wood of which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
house was built throughout, and all of which had to
be brought from below Cresta; and then to make the
most of the heat of the stove, the fuel for which,
whether wood or turf, was very costly to them; every
piece of the latter having been paid for with so much
of the precious time of their brief summer, and of the
former with very large demands upon the muscular
tissues of their own bodies, while cutting it in winter,
and getting it across the ravine opposite to Cresta.
The stove was a large structure, and filled about a
fourth part of the room. The object of its size was
that it might have as much heat-radiating surface as
possible. It was fed by an opening not in our sitting
room, but in the kitchen behind it. At last the milk
was warmed, brought in, and placed on the table in a
large bowl. In this was placed a wooden ladle to
dip out the milk with. The bowl was flanked on one
side with the loaf of black rye-bread, which, as it was
moist and fresh, was preferable to the desiccated
wheaten bread of the <i>Pasteur’s</i> establishment; and
on the other side with the two kinds of cheese. Of
these the fat variety was so old as to have almost lost
its consistency, and with its consistency had almost
gone its goaty flavour; the meagre variety had the
texture of new soap, while its flavour was that which
may be imagined of soap which has somehow or other
become somewhat insipid. I asked for a knife to cut
the loaf and the cheese. Had not the Herr a knife of
his own in his pocket? No other kind of knife was used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
at Juf. This being their practice with respect to knives,
of course forks were altogether unknown. The Herr
happened to have a knife in his pocket, and was not
sorry that his not having thought of using it had thrown
some light on the table arrangements of Juf, which do
not admit of anything that would require a fork, or any
kind of knife, except that which is carried in the
pocket. These particulars do not seem inviting, but
it must be remembered where we were, what was
the <i>entourage</i>, and what the conditions of the situation,
and it will then become intelligible how it could
have been that this Juf dinner, if that word may be used
for what was before us, would not have been left, if
one had been called on to make a choice between the
two, for a Lord Mayor’s banquet in the Egyptian
Hall.</p>

<p>We, and our ways, appeared as interesting to the
Juffians, as they and their ways to us, if we might
judge by the attention with which we were observed by
the levée of old men and old women, and young women
too, who came in, and took possession of the benches
fastened against the wall, which surrounded the room,
except in the stove corner. The room contained no
other seats than these benches. Among our visitors
was a poor fellow who had broken his leg on the
mountains; and, the fracture not having been properly
reduced, he was now sadly crippled, and complained
of the pains he felt at moving, and at every
change of the weather. He never then, I thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
can be long together up here, at all events at midsummer,
without having his sufferings aggravated by
the latter cause. From what I understood of what
we now had to do, I was sure that my porter would
be quite unequal to his work, I, therefore, made inquiries
for one who would act as guide and porter
across the Pass. A venerable senior among the company
had a son, who, he assured me, was exactly the
man I was in want of; and so he went to fetch him.</p>

<p>I paid five francs for our entertainment. I estimated
its fair price rather by the satisfaction it had
given to myself, than by what it had cost my hostess;
that satisfaction was heightened at seeing how her
old weather-beaten, stove-dried features relaxed and
brightened as she took into her withered hand the
little flake of gold, which perhaps was the easiest
earned payment she had ever received in her long
hard life. The balance between the services rendered
and the value of them to their recipient, having been
thus adjusted to the contentment of both parties, and
the youth who was to accompany us over the Pass
having arrived, we recommenced our march at one
o’clock. There was nothing about him to indicate
that he had been cradled in so rude a climate. He
was tall and slim, yet well and strongly built. His
features were fine and regular, and his complexion
fair, almost to girlishness.</p>

<p>Before us was the long <i>cul de sac</i> of the head of
the valley. We had to ascend the left mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
diagonally almost from Juf to the visible summit,
about two miles off. For the most part there was no
path at all, or our young guide could do better than
following it. His long, sure, smooth stride, as he glided
up the slant of the mountain, seemed like some new
kind of pace; it was hardly walking. We found it no
easy task to keep up with him, which we only did, in
Irish style, by following him as well as we could. When
we left Juf the sun was bright, but as we ascended
higher we saw a dark storm advancing towards us from
the direction of Cresta. It might not, however, reach
us; and for the present we had the sun, in the warmth
of which even the marmots were rejoicing, for we frequently
heard the shrill cries of their sentinels announcing
the presence of an enemy, and saw those that
had taken the alarm scrambling back to their earths.
When we were approaching the summit, the diagonal
direction of the ascent ceased for a time, and we had
for three or four hundred feet to go straight up the
mountain. This was the only bit of the Pass which
at all required attention to what we were about. It
was something like walking up one of the angles of
the tower of York Minster, supposing that angle to
have become so dilapidated as to give from bottom
to top an almost perpendicular, irregular staircase.
This is, I believe, what is called in mountaineering
phraseology an <i>arête</i>, that is the edge of a mountain
rib, or shoulder. Here the rib, or shoulder, was not
far from perpendicular, and could not be crossed. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
had, therefore, to be ascended, and its edge had been
nicked into steps all the way up, partly by nature, and
partly by the pickaxe. As I was going up this
mountain staircase, and saw the storm below me, no
great way off now, I hoped it would not catch me
upon it. In that case I thought there will be some
chance of my being blown off. We were, however,
soon over this bit, which also proved almost too high
for the storm, for not much of it reached up to where
we were, about 1,700 feet above Juf.</p>

<p>This Pass presents a scene of solid, rugged desolation,
of dreary grandeur, as approached from the Juf
side. The way to the summit lies across one of the
crateriform depressions, which are not uncommon in
such situations, between two mighty peaks, with torn
and shattered pinnacles. The whole scene is hereabouts
so storm-beaten, and frost-bitten, as to be
apparently incapable of supporting even a lichen.
Everything on which the eye rests is in character—rocks
protruded, and rocks shivered, of a dull dark
colour, pools of water equally dark, and patches of
new summer snow; the whole made more forbidding
to-day by icy gusts and pelting sleet.</p>

<p>And now that we have traversed the whole valley
from the junction of the Averser with the Hinter
Rhein to the summit of the Pass, upon which we are
about to step, we are able to understand how its
Oberland comes to be the highest inhabited valley in
Europe. But we will review the whole of it. Our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
way up has been through three well defined stages.
It began with the Ferrerathal, the first stage. That
is comparatively low ground; in respect of altitude it
has no special interest. It possesses only the ordinary
Swiss interest of being bounded by mountains
more or less rocky and precipitous, of maintaining
forests more or less shady and vigorous, interspersed
at the mouths of lateral valleys with small pieces of
grass-land, which give space for the support of their
respective little villages. So, too, with the second
stage from Canicül to Campsut. The difference here
is that the forest has become far more damp and
mossy, and the mountains, especially at the triple
watersmeet, more precipitous and iron-faced, and the
stream more impetuous, and that there is an entire
absence of prairies, indeed even of margin. From
Campsut, the third stage, the particular of inhabited
altitude becomes interesting. This portion is divided
into two parts, that from Campsut to Cresta, and that
from Cresta to Juf. In the first the mountain ranges
begin to recede from each other; and as the forest
has been made to confine itself to the rocky mountain
side, there is in the middle a good expanse of grass
land, capable of supporting many cattle. But as to
the cultivation of anything else we have now got too
high for that. At Cresta, which is over against the
last trees, there is for about a mile a narrowing in
again of the valley. It then spreads out once more,
and continues wide all the way up to Juf. In this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
last part lies its chief interest, for under ordinary
Alpine conditions, though the grass might still be
available in summer, so elevated a valley would be
unfit for human habitation. What, then, is there
here to counteract the ordinary conditions? The
answer is the height and direction of the ranges.
They run from east to west, closing in completely at
the eastern end. The broad valley, therefore, is
thoroughly protected from the cold winds of the north
and east, completely open to the south, and no ray
of sunlight with its accompanying warmth is intercepted.
Still, notwithstanding, there might be a condition
which would neutralize these advantages; for
instance, if the valley were closed with a glacier, or
had glaciers from either of the bounding ranges descending
into it, the place would probably be unfit for
human residence. There is, however, nothing of the
kind; the head of the valley and the bounding
ranges are not of such a height as to support snowfields
and their glaciers. It is, therefore, the presence
of the favourable conditions that have been mentioned,
and the absence of the unfavourable ones, which make
the grassy expanse of Oberland Aversthal the highest
inhabited ground in Europe.</p>

<p>As you begin the descent of the Forcellina on its
northern side you come upon two or three pieces of
old snow. Beneath these—it may be about 700 feet
from the summit—flowers suddenly become abundant;
among many others the charming little Alpine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
forget-me-not, a purple pansy as large as a shilling,
and a clear dark-blue little gentian. About 400 feet
more of descent bring you to a grassy bottom—there
are no trees in sight—which is in reality the summit
of the Septimer Pass from Casaccia at the head of
the Bregaglia to Stalla on the Julier. In calculating
the day’s work I had supposed that, as the books
spoke of the Septimer being a Pass on this route in
the same sense as the Forcellina, we should have had
to descend so much from the Forcellina as to have
had to ascend somewhat on the Septimer. This expectation
was wholly unfounded: for to those who
take it from the direction we did every step upon it
is downhill: to them it is only the descent of the
Forcellina. To those, however, who take it reversely
and who are also going on by Stalla to the Julier,
and not by the Forcellina to Juf, it is a Pass, and one
with a stiff ascent of at least two hours.</p>

<p>The way to Casaccia was now along an old paved
road, said to have been constructed by the Romans.
The pavement consists of blocks of gneiss, and is
generally in good preservation. On the summit it is
lost, either because it is now buried beneath the turf,
or because in this part of it its stones were taken up to
build the hospice the ruins of which you pass, and
the wall that enclosed some space around it. There
are some places, in which you would have expected
to find it buried, or carried away by storm-torrents,
but in which it is still in good order, and much in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
same state as I will not say its first, because it is
safer to say its last, constructors left it. For as we
are told that German as well as Roman Emperors
used it for the transit of their armies, we must infer
that those who last used it for this purpose repaired
whatever damages time had done to it. I saw pieces
of it on the very edge of the stream, where it must
sweep over it with great force, but which were still
quite uninjured. I was surprised at its general width,
as well as at the size of the stones with which it is
paved. I say general width, because there are some
interesting exceptions. These occur at points where
the roadway could not have been enlarged to its
general width without cutting through a projecting
rock. That on a great military road the inconvenience—very
great to an army on the march—of these
narrow places was submitted to shows that it would
have been very costly in old times to have cut away
such rocks; a work which a few handfuls of some explosive
would now effect in a morning. It also
shows that if wheeled carriages were ever used on this
road their gauge must have been very small. Some
five miles of the old pavement still remain. I have
seen very similar bits of Roman road on Judæan
hills. The sight of this drew from the circumnavigator
the sceptical remark, that it was a very
good road (he meant too good an one) for those times.</p>

<p>In descending this old historical, but now deserted
route, on which even a centrifugal tourist is seldom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
seen, I could not but think of its older and better
days. Those granite blocks, on which I was treading,
had felt the tramp of Roman armies marching, it
might have been, to the Danube, to secure that
threatened frontier of the Empire against barbarian
aggression. The couriers who brought the intelligence
of victories from which much was hoped, and
of disasters from which much was feared, had
traversed it with quicker steps than those with which
I was then descending it. At Rome, and in the cities
and villas of northern Italy, the despatches of which
they were the bearers had been anxiously looked for.
After a time the mind’s eye could see hordes of barbarians
swarming down its steep pavement to
plunder, and to overthrow, the civilization, to aid in
the protection of which it had been constructed.
Time had turned the tables.</p>

<p>But probably there had been an earlier, and unrecorded
chapter in its history. We know that there
had been in almost prehistoric times an Etruscan
Dodecapolis established in the plain of the Po, and
which reached down to the Adriatic, an offset of the
original Dodecapolis between the Apennines and the
Tyrrhenian sea. The inhabitants of these confederations
of cities were the earliest known organizers of
commerce in Europe. That they were great in
maritime commerce implies this, for maritime commerce
presupposes inland and overland trade. Now
in those times tin and copper must have been among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
the most coveted articles of European commerce, because
it was from a combination of them that the
best tools and weapons then procurable were formed;
and there is a very high degree of probability in
favour of the supposition that Britain was even in
those early days the chief source for the indispensable
tin, and if of the tin, then almost necessarily of
some of the copper at that time so abundantly used;
and as we can hardly suppose that the way to
Britain through the Pillars of Hercules was then used
as a highway of commerce, we are almost driven to
the conclusion that they were brought down to the
shores of the Mediterranean by overland carriage.
Some of the traffic may have centred at some port on
the Gulf of Lyons, perhaps at the point which afterwards
became Massilia, for of course it was an inland
trade that supported the maritime commerce of
Massilia, and made it rich and populous, and powerful.
That part, however, of the traffic, of which the
Etruscan Dodecapolis of the plain of the Po and of the
Adriatic was the <i lang="fr">entrepôt</i>, in all probability came
over the Julier and the Septimer. In thinking of
those remote times the necessity of the existence of a
very considerable inland traffic has been almost entirely
lost sight of. This was far the most potent
agency then at work among the barbarians of
Europe, precisely in the same manner as ocean commerce
is in these days of ours far the most potent
agency now at work over the whole world. We have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
many indications of it in the trade in gold as well as
in that of tin and copper. These commodities were
widely carried about, and very generally dispersed.
This active and continuous traffic implies the existence
of certain well-established, and regularly used
routes. And all this reached far back beyond any
historical traditions. The traffic in the bulky article
of salt also must needs have been of equal antiquity.
That the inhabitants of northern and central Europe
were tribes of barbarians is no argument against the
existence of these kinds of traffic. They did exist.
And as to the people who carried them on being barbarians,
whatever that might have amounted to, they
were not such savages as the negroes of central
Africa now are; and we know that they can appreciate
the value of the ivory trade, and of that in
ostrich feathers, and gold dust, which commodities,
under the guidance of Arab, and Banian, and Nubian
traders, they collect at stations and marts in the interior,
to be furthered to the coast, and thence to be
dispersed over the world. And this they did also in
the time of the Pharaohs, three and four thousand
years ago, as we know from still existing Egyptian
sculptures and paintings. The ivory that was expended
in the decoration of the palace of Ahab and
of the kings of Assyria was doubtless procured from
this source, and in this fashion. The barbarians,
then, of central Europe, aided and instructed by
Etruscan merchants, might, though perhaps we ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
to use a stronger auxiliary, and say must, have done
the same by the tin, and perhaps the copper, of Cornwall.
And this way of the Septimer was in all probability
the route a part of their trade in these
articles took. If so it cannot have been but that
Etruscan traders were in those times to be seen every
year in Britain. They had landed at Dover. They
had trafficked at the British <i lang="fr">entrepôt</i> of Londinium.
They must have had some kind of establishment
there. They had not stopped there. They had
gone on to the mines from which the tin was extracted,
and had looked out on the western ocean
from the Land’s End.</p>

<p>As I walked down the Septimer, constructing in
my mind this chain of inferences, I saw by my side
the large-boned, sturdy Etruscan trader, overlooking
his party of barbarian porters, loaded with tin and
copper, and perhaps with some amber, which he had
been twelve months, or more, in collecting, and which
he had paid for with the gold jewelry, in the workmanship
of which those Dodecapoleis were so skilful,
and in later times perhaps with iron knives, and
daggers, and spear and arrow-heads. Again this
trade must have had established routes, and for the
eastern Dodecapolis the most likely route must have
been the Julier and the Septimer; and it must have
had some organisers and managers, and it is in these
cities that we must look for them.</p>

<p>Commerce, then, first traced this road. Of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
it must have had some halting stations, and <i lang="fr">depôts</i>,
and these could only have been at such places as
Casaccia, Stalla, Molins, and Tiefenkasten. Some of
these, doubtless, were fortified, and made capable of
maintaining a small garrison against sudden attacks
of barbarians, just like the forts of our Hudson’s Bay
Company. Then came its imperial days, when it
connected the capital and heart of the world with a
threatened frontier. But commerce has now taken
other channels, and empire has established itself in
other seats, and the barbarians have become the foremost
nations of the world; and this road is only
traversed occasionally by a few northern travellers,
descended from the barbarians, or from the kindred of
the barbarians, it was constructed to keep back, but
who now have no other object in traversing it than to
see deep valleys and lofty mountains. For many
centuries change has everywhere else been actively at
work, but the poor herdsmen who dwelt round about
the Septimer remained in much the same condition as
their predecessors of the old imperial and commercial
periods of its history. Hitherto there had been little
change for them. It was only yesterday that they
were as hard-pressed and as poor as their remote
forefathers had been. Their only resource was still
their cows, and what little their cows enabled them to
get of the products of sunnier valleys, and of the
plains below. Human societies, however, are now
entering on a new phase of their long progress, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
distinguishing features of which are that culture is
becoming accessible to all, even to the children of
these herdsmen; that mind can now find a station,
and a market anywhere; and that new avenues to
obtaining the means of living are being opened on all
sides to all men, who have the capacity and the will
to enter upon them. And what is changing the rest
of the world has not been unfelt up here. Many now
go out from these valleys into the world, and after a
time return with the proceeds of their labour and
thrift. And, too, the outside world having advanced
to a point which enables it to take an interest in the
aspects which nature wears up here, sends hither,
yearly, many visitors. This also supplies means of
living to some. Life has, in consequence, become easy
to many, and less hard and narrow to all. And these
advantages, which are far from being altogether of a
material kind, at all events they both rest on and lead
on to, what is moral and intellectual, are year by year
being extended to greater numbers.</p>

<p>As I walked down the single street of Casaccia
the contrast it presented in externals to Cresta and
Juf was felt to be great indeed; but when I entered
the hotel the contrast between its interior and those
with which I had yesterday and this morning become
acquainted was felt to be greater still. To one coming
from the mountains—it seemed as if one had been
sojourning among them for a long time—its single
reception room had an air even of amplitude and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
loftiness. One noticed, as one might something that
is not seen every day, that chairs and sofas had taken
the place of benches against the wall. Table linen,
too, had reappeared, for the table was ready spread as
far as the usual condiments and appliances go. This
indicated the possibility of such a supper as would
require such aid. In this house—it is often so with
small inns in Italy, and Italian influences begin to be
felt at Casaccia—there was no attempt to shunt the
kitchen out of sight. Here it had to be passed through
to reach the stone staircase that led up to the bedrooms.
The landings and passages were spacious for
the size of the house; and so in a still greater degree
was the bedroom into which I was shown. It had
two windows; but, as they were small and deep-recessed,
they did not admit a sufficiency of light;
and the ceiling and panelling being of a dark coloured
pine-wood, this scanty allowance of light was not
made the most of. There was about the room, and
its contents, a look of newness from disuse, or rather
of oldness kept new by disuse. It had three beds.
These it was evident were not frequently required, for
the bed-clothes had been put away beneath the
mattresses; and the washing apparatus for the possible
occupants of the three beds was all arranged on one
of the deep-recessed window-sills, as if it was regarded
rather as something to be looked at than used. This
also led me to infer that the windows were seldom
opened: an inference which was not contradicted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
a kind of solidity and ancientness in the atmosphere
of the room. The lock on the door was very un-Swiss,
and very Italian. Everybody knows that
every lock on every door of every bedroom in every
hotel in Switzerland is a little plain black iron box
applied to the surface of the door. Here it was a
highly elaborated specimen of the locksmith’s art: all
open iron-work, with a marvellously large and complicated
key, and an equally marvellous arrangement of
bolts. For some little time I despaired of being able
to discover how the key was to be inserted, or used;
and feared that, if I should succeed in turning it, I
might not be able to turn it back again. Such a lock
would not have been out of place on the door of some
floridly decorated old Chapter House, or of the
banqueting hall of some mediæval castle. The good
man of the house assured me that the room should be
arranged for me immediately. It was then five o’clock.
It was, however, not till night had come down on
Casaccia that this immediate arrangement was taken
in hand. On that day, at all events, he was the only
person who was in the house, and so he had to obtain
from outside the female hands that were needed for
the immediate arrangement. At last he impressed
for this little service two of his neighbours—I suppose
to atone for the delay by showing that he was ready
to do all that was in his power, even more than was
really needed.</p>

<p>As to the good man himself; in his making, as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
that of the lock, there was nothing Swiss. He was
altogether unlike the hardy sturdy people I had been
among lately. The loss of a few thousand feet of altitude
had made a great difference in the elements of
the human composition. His figure was tall, but not
erect. His muscular tissue was soft. His features
were large without being coarse. His hair and eyes
were of a jet black, though in the latter there was
none of that twinkling rapidity of motion, which is
characteristic of the children of the south. His face
was quite smooth. His complexion was the bloodless
and untinted, but not unhealthy, white of many
Italian women, and of some Italian men. He had
none of the volubility of utterance, or quickness of
manner of the Italian. On the contrary; his voice
and manner were as smooth as his face. Smoothness,
indeed, was his pervading characteristic. His smile
was smooth, but it was the smile of manner, not of
the heart, and indicated not pleasure, but the wish to
please, or rather to make, and keep, things smooth.
His dress even was smooth, and studiedly so. To
him would have been intolerable anything so rough
as Swiss homespun. His step was inaudible as he
glided in and out of the room. What he did for you
in placing things on the table, or removing them, was
done as it were by the shadow of a man. He would
have deemed it barbarous to have disturbed, he
would have shrunk from disturbing, you even with a
sound. His business was to assist, and to please. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
had asked him what I could have for supper? He
had replied with the gentlest tone, with a forward
inclination of his body, and with a half smile, ‘Whatever
I pleased.’ ‘Could I have mutton cutlets?’
‘Certainly.’ ‘In half an hour?’ ‘Certainly.’ In an
hour and a half the supper was placed noiselessly on
the table. It was announced in the form that the
cutlets were served. They proved, however, to be of
veal, as doubtless he had foreknown that they would
be; but it had seemed to him harsh to tell a man
that he could not have what he wanted. In like
manner it was now deemed unnecessary to call attention
to any deviation from what had been promised
and expected; or to say a word that might imply
that anything could possibly be otherwise than as you
had wished. Did not his manner give you to understand
that he had done all, and would continue to do
all, in his power to supply your wants, and to contribute
to your comfort? Everything was said and
done so smoothly, that it was impossible for you by
an exhibition of surprise, or of dissatisfaction to break
the spell of smoothness that had been cast over you.
We affect bluntness, and even roughness, under the
supposition that they indicate honesty and independence
of character. The Italian—and this Casaccian
was Italian in mind and manner—does not value the
exhibition of these qualities. He affects gentleness,
mildness, blandness both for their own sake, and
because they are means to his ends. This is his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
idea of civilization; and it is what we, perhaps, may
come to when our civilization shall have become as
old as his. Our manners may, then, have become
more soft, more pliant, more politic. The time may
arrive when we too shall consider it uncivilized to say
or do what will produce needless mental jars. Our
present ideas may indicate that we are nearer than the
Italians to the woods and caves.</p>

<p><i>August 10.</i>—As I had undertaken to present myself
to-day at Pontresina in time for an early dinner, I
engaged a <i>char</i> at Casaccia to take me as far as <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Moritz; and having walked to the top of the Maloja,
was there overtaken by it. The Maloja has an
altitude of only 5,941 feet, which makes it the lowest of
all the passes by which Italy may be entered from
Switzerland. Its ascent from Casaccia is over an
excellent road, with a rise of 1,150 feet, the latter
part of which is through well-grown pine woods. I
reached the summit so much in advance of my carriage
as to have plenty of time for contemplating the backward
view of the upper reach of the Bregaglia over
the head of the forest—a view which was well worth
the time.</p>

<p>The books tell us so much of the peculiarities,
interest, and beauties of the Upper Engadin, that
every one who goes to see it expects much; and I
cannot think that there will be many of those who see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
it, who will feel any disappointment. In respect of
length, and of capability for supporting human life, it
may be equalled, or exceeded, by other Swiss Valleys,
as for instance by those of the Rhine, of the Rhone,
and of the Ticino, but there are other particulars of
interest in which it leaves them all far behind. The
great point is that it combines an elevation above
the sea, which is elsewhere found to be but ill suited
for supporting human life with an amount of population
which would in any other valley be regarded as
considerable; and that this large amount of population
is evidently maintained in circumstances of comparative
comfort. Beginning at the height just
mentioned, it descends at first so gradually that at
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Moritz, twelve miles down the valley, the stream
is only 150 feet below the summit of the Pass; while
the town of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Moritz itself, which is 300 feet above
the stream, is actually 150 feet higher than the
summit of the Pass. And in the sixty miles of its
course from the Maloja to Martinsbruck it only loses
2,598 feet. The effect, too, of its actual elevation
upon vegetable, and therefore, upon human life, must
be somewhat aggravated by its direction, which being
to the north-east exposes it to cold winds, and renders
it, moreover, somewhat unfavourable for the reception
of sunshine. And, then, its temperature is still
further lowered by the contiguity on either side of
many snowy summits. These conditions make in its
upper parts all kinds of cultivation, except that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
grass, almost impossible. I saw this day at <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Moritz,
and a little above it, some few potato patches, but as
in every instance the haulm of these had been killed
back by recent midsummer frosts, nothing this year
would be got from them but disappointment. Still I
found this part of the valley surprisingly populous,
for it contains what almost may be called a chain of
little towns, in every one of which are several good
houses, and in not one of which is there the slightest
indication of any approach to pauperism. The
absence, however, of this form of wretchedness might
almost have been expected, because where the winter
is eight or nine months long no family can exist
which has not some assured means of living. But
this does not explain the well-to-do condition you
must infer is the lot of many, whose substantial and
neatly kept houses you see in every one of these
little towns. Nature you conclude at a glance
is too niggard here to maintain so many well-to-do
families; you begin then to inquire how they are
maintained? Whence come their means? What are
they living upon?</p>

<p>The answer to these questions is worth obtaining
not only for the sake of what it will tell us of the
history of these people’s lives, but also because it will
remind us of a change that is now coming over the
whole world. These good people are living mainly
upon capital, either upon the interest of capital invested
in good securities, or upon the dividends of capital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
employed in such ventures as are open to them. This
is a fact of Grison life to which reference has already
been made, and to which we shall have to recur again.
The reader is already aware that my companion, the
circumnavigator, who was now seated by my side,
was one of those who had failed in the Grison method
of wooing fortune; but the owners of almost all these
good houses had been successful wooers, for the good
houses that belong to old Grison families are comparatively
few. You pass a house which appears to
be a goodly mansion. It covers a great deal of ground,
is solidly built, and of two, or possibly of three, stories.
It may not, however, be quite so large a dwelling-house
as it looks, for the ground floor, or part of it, is
perhaps a stable for half-a-dozen, or more, cows, and
a couple of horses—these are seldom kept in outhouses.
And this house may also contain a haystack sufficiently
large to maintain these cows and horses for
seven or eight months. Still after these deductions
have been made it is a goodly house, and much
ornamented, for its owner is proud of it; and the
question arises, Whence came the money to purchase
the land on which it stands, then to build it, then to
buy the land which supplies the hay, and last, but not
least, of all to support the family in comfort according
to Engadin ideas? The money required for all this
must have been a considerable sum, and the valley of
the Inn has hitherto offered no opportunities for
making such sums. In the particular case now before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
us it was all made by selling little cups of coffee, and
still smaller glasses of liqueurs, at Paris. And before
its owner could begin this small trade on his own
account, he had to serve some years as waiter in an
hotel; for he took no capital with him to Paris except
the determination to get on. That was then all his
stock in trade, but it was of such a kind as to be
enough for the purpose. It was ultimately upon that
foundation that the big house was built. His pecuniary
savings began in the hotel. By the time he had
learnt the ways and the language of the place, he had
saved enough to commence the sale on his own account
of the little cups of coffee, and smaller glasses of
liqueurs. With what care must the cent or two that
was made by each cup, or glass, have been guarded!
How rarely were any of them spent in self-indulgence!
It was self-indulgence enough to look forward to the
house in the Engadin, with the thought that its owner
would become one of the aristocracy of the valley;
and to find at the end of the week that the life-supporting
prospect—the ambition of a life, was so
many francs nearer to realization. The next house
was built by one who had rolled up his francs by
vending little cakes, and small confectionery at Vienna.
The process had been throughout the same. You
inquire about a third with a coat of arms over the
door, and gilt lattice at the window. Its owner
climbed the ladder by becoming a <i>bon-bon</i> maker at
Brussels. After half a life spent in unswerving fidelity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
to their single purpose these keen accumulators of
small gains had made enough to enable them to take
their ease for the rest of their days in Paris, Vienna,
or Brussels; but that was not what they had been
slaving and saving for. Of the 100,000 francs each of
them had made, each invested the greater part in some
good security, and the rest he expended in buying a
piece of land, and in building a house, in that valley
that has the climate of Iceland; and this house and
land together with the money invested, which enables
him to live in the house, is his unquestioned patent of
nobility. In right of his manifestly achieved success
he assumes his place in the aristocracy of the valley.</p>

<p>This is a spontaneously formed, and self-acting
system. The distinction is real and substantial, and
the way to it is open to all, and must be travelled by
all who attain to the distinction, and none who travel
it successfully can miss the distinction. With us it is
different. Here there are many ways of making
money, and but few only of those who have trodden
successfully some one or other of the many ways
attain to the splendid summits of society. It is not so
in the Grisons. There the man who makes the money
in the hard and humble way open to him, and builds
the big house, and lives in it, becomes <i lang="la">ipso facto</i> a
Grison grandee. He climbed up to his Herrship by
a ladder that was very difficult to mount, but was
equally accessible to all; and every one that climbs it
enters the charmed circle. Enterprise, self-denial, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
patience; great enterprise, for it is that in a penniless
peasant to go out into the unknown world to compete
with the natives of some great foreign city, unflinching
self-denial, and heroical patience are the only course
open to them. If the same mental stuff is needed for
the making of the Cæsar of the village as of the Cæsar
of the world, then we may suppose that under different
circumstances, these men would have risen to eminence
through higher paths. They were made of good stuff.
We see in them men, who had their lot been cast here,
would have become Lord Chancellors, Admirals,
Generals, Statesmen, Scholars, merchant Princes,
perhaps even Bishops.</p>

<p>But these successful builders of big houses are not
all the people; and we must not allow their big houses
to hide from our view the small houses of these little
towns, and the small people who live in them. All
men have not the same gifts; and of those who have
all do not exercise them alike and to like issues.
Many may have had the enterprise without the heroical
self-denial and patience, which in some cases may
mean a narrow horizon and a hard heart, but which
narrow horizon and hard heart were necessary for
success in the case of such small traffickers. And
some, too, may have had the self-denial and the
patience in heroical degrees, and not been deficient
either in the requisite enterprise, but yet were kept
back from turning these qualities to good account by
the goodness of their hearts. That may have kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
them at home to provide for, and to tend, an aged
parent in his chair-days; or an early affection may
have influenced them to the same result. And so
possibly there may be as good stuff, intellectually and
morally, among those who have never left the village
as among those who went forth into the world, and
prospered. Chance, too, has a place in the affairs of
men. Good fortune does not always mean good
conduct, nor bad fortune bad conduct. Conduct that
was both wise and good may have had ill-fortuned
results. But we will set these cases aside, and ask if
those who, because they stayed at home for good
reasons, and so are now in no better condition than
their fathers were, and those who went forth and
prospered, find in any sense their rewards equal?
Certainly not, if both of them measure, as the world
does, all things by francs. Still each has his reward,
and the reward of satisfied affections, and of a satisfied
sense of duty, is great as it is felt at the moment, for
at that time every consideration gives way to it; and
it is great also in retrospect, which is the recalling of
the feelings of that moment. We are glad, then, to
witness the success of those who made the francs, and
built the stone houses, and to talk with them of their
experiences of the world in which the francs were
made; but this does not diminish our respect for
those who stayed at home, and who will live, and toil,
and die in the same small wooden <i lang="fr">châlets</i> in which
their fathers lived, and toiled, and died. Indeed, our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
respect for them, and even our disposition to like
them, are rather increased by the sight of the big
mansions of the lemonade, and bon-bon, and coffee
and confectionery lords.</p>

<p>So much in explanation of the big houses we find
not only in the Engadin, but more or less in all the
Grison valleys. We now come to the valley itself.
The sun on this day was unclouded; but we were on
the road from the Maloja to <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Moritz; these words,
therefore, must not be taken to mean what they
would stand for had they been said of a drive from
Bath to Bristol. We all know what a cloudless day
is here in the middle of August: in the Upper
Engadin it is not quite the same sort of thing. With
respect to what meets the eye: there is no trace of
haze; the definition of every mountain and glacier
outline is sharp and clear; the luminous blue is not
blue, or luminous, in our subdued fashion; and even
the greens and grays of the mountains are hardly less
green and gray quite up to the distant sky-line.
There is little toning down. Distance only blends
the local variegation into an uniform colour. You
cannot make out the variegation of the flowery turf,
of the lichen-painted rock, and of the glancing foliage
and shaded trunks of the forest, on account of the
distance: that is all. The distance as it were fuses
together the smaller differences; and then it puts a
varnish over the whole: the clear bright air is the
varnish. Then as to the appeal this diaphanous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
rarefied air makes to the sense of feeling: though, indeed,
it is not air; that is a word that here would mislead;
it is a celestial ether; and so with the sun, though
it is hot, what you feel is not heat; it is a permeating,
invigorating, life-creating warmth; this warmth,
then, which the sun imparts to this ether, pervades
your lungs, your heart, and reaches to your very bones.
It makes you conscious of a lighter, and of a quicker
life than you ever felt before. Like the air of the
desert it so rapidly, so instantaneously evaporates the
imperceptible perspiration that the skin beneath your
clothes as well as that of your face develops a new
sensation. It has ceased to be merely a tough, half-dead
integument, whose function is just to protect you
from external rubs. As the flower expands to the
light, and turns to it, from the satisfaction it has in
absorbing it, so your skin has become sensitive to this
ether, and feels the delight of being in contact with it.
And a third sense has yet to be gladdened. Up here
it is now the middle of hay harvest, and the air is
pervaded with the fragrance of the new hay. And
you are all the way passing by, or through, pine-forests,
and the bright sun is constantly raising into
the air from their trunks, branches, and leaves myriad
molecules of their resinous exudations; and this perfume
also is wafted to you.</p>

<p>And then the scene has its peculiar features. In
these twelve miles you pass four lakes; the small lake
of the Maloja summit, the Silser see, four and a half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
miles long, the Silva Planer see somewhat longer, and
that of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Moritz about a mile in length. Thus,
throughout almost all the way, you are driving along
this chain of lakes, on a road a little above them. Of
the colour of these mountain lakes our English home-trained
eyes know nothing. It must be seen to be
understood. It is of the blue of the sky, only a shade
less deep, and with some slight admixture of green.
You wonder what the trout that live in them can find
to live upon in water so pure, and which, in truth, is
not water, but the lymph of the celestial depths—heaven’s
azure liquefied. Everyone feels the charm of
water as an addition to the scene: but such lakes as
these, which are not of water, but of some less earthly
fluid, how great is the charm they add to this scene!
And the more so, if you have come upon them suddenly
after some days of trudging and toiling in the
mountains, where the eyes were wearied, almost
wounded, with the continual recurrence of pinnacles
and precipices, rocks and ravines, nothing but what
was hard, dark, jagged, and torn. The impressions of
sombreness, ruggedness, and terror that had of late
been stamped on your brain, and seemed to be in it
like things that were alive, are now laid to rest by the
sight of the smooth blue: its effects are soothing and
healing.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of this road is the number of
glaciers and snow summits that are seen from it. Of
these, too, as it is with the blue lakes, you are hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
ever out of sight. You come abreast of a lateral
valley; and as you look up it you see at its head a
mighty glacier, the view of which seems so complete
that you think you can make out its whole course,
that is to say its whole life, from the snowfield out of
which it is compacted, and by which it is forced on,
till at last it issues, in another form, from its own
mouth. Or a range before you recedes a little, or
becomes depressed a little, and you see at this point a
mighty snow-capped giant from behind peering over
into the valley; and you feel the current of crisp
air that is flowing down into the valley from the
glacier, or from the giant’s head—the breath of the
glacier, or of the giant. And in the twelve miles you
pass as many towns as you do lakes; one for every
three miles: all clean, and flourishing: and not a
dilapidated hovel in a land where nothing is grown
but grass, and where there are nine months of winter
and three of cold, with the exception of a few such
days as was to-day! This absence of visible poverty
adds much to the sense of satisfaction with which you
contemplate the scene. Nature here has made it
difficult for man to live upon his fellow man, for a
man, under the conditions here imposed upon him,
can hardly do more than support himself. Of course
three-fourths of the population might be cleared off,
and half the quantity of cattle maintained; but that
is not the turn things took here. Every man, excepting
the capitalists we have already spoken of, and no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
one grudges them their hard-earned accumulations,
which besides do good to some, and no harm to
anyone, everyone, excepting them, must work hard to
live; but to live here by his hard work a man must
himself have the fruits of it.</p>

<p>The direction in which the stream by your side is
flowing is often an ingredient in the thought of the
wanderer among these mountains of central Europe.
‘This stream,’ he says to himself, ‘is hurrying to join
the Po, or the Rhine, or the Rhone.’ On this day I said
to myself, ‘These charming lakes are among the head
Waters of the Danube.’ The little stream we passed
as it came racing down from Monte Lunghino into
the Silser see is the furthest urn of the Inn. This
makes you feel that you have passed into another
region. The continent is now inclining in another
direction. The Danube, and the Black Sea for a time
become the goal of your thoughts of this kind. In
this respect Lunghino along the eastern roots of which
I was now passing, and the opposite side of which I
had traversed yesterday, is pre-eminent, for it contains
the diffluent urns of three great historic rivers,
the Rhine, the Po, and the Danube; of the Rhine by
giving birth to one of the feeders of the Oberhalbstein
stream, of the Po by giving birth to a feeder
of the Maira, which joins the Adda as it is on the
point of entering the lake of Como, and of the
Danube by giving birth to the actual head water of
the Inn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>A little more than a mile before you reach <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Moritz, you look down on the old monster Kurhaus,
and a new and more monstrous one nearly completed.
They are upon the alluvial flat at the head of the
lake. As I saw by my side a patch or two of potatoes
smitten by summer frosts, I thought it strange that
any people, possessed of free agency, especially invalids,
could be found to descend into, and to stay in,
such a place. With what ice-cold vapour must the
evaporation from that alluvial bottom load the air so
soon in the afternoon as the sun is off the ground, and
down there they cannot have much of him! And
how cutting must the cold wind be down there! Is
there anything that can compensate for these evils?
I doubt much whether mineral waters can that sometimes
are in fashion, and sometimes are forsaken.
But there will always be plenty of people who will try
anything of this kind, and there will always be some
who will endeavour to persuade people to resort to
such supposed remedies. One would like to know
what is the proportion of people who go to these
places a second time, not for the sake of the society
they expect to find at them, but for the sake of the
waters; and whether the proportion of actual cures is
much greater than of the cures effected by touching
the bones, or the old clothes, of some supposed saint.
If after two or three weeks at such a place as this a
man finds himself no worse than when he reached it,
he may infer that after all his system is not so far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
enfeebled but that air, exercise, and diet may do
something for him.</p>

<p>The above wayside remark is made subject to
correction from those who thoroughly understand
these subjects. There is, however, another way of
looking at this charming lake, with the green forest
that descends to it from the opposite mountain, and
beyond the lake the valley opening up to Pontresina,
and with the long varied vistas up and down the main
valley, and with the little town of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Moritz, perched
on its niche on the mountain side, close before you.
There is so much variety, so many objects, so much
colour, and everything is so clear and fresh, and so
bright in the sunshine, that you can hardly think the
scene belongs to the same world as you are accustomed
to at home. It hardly looks real, the difference
is so great. It looks like something got up to please
and astonish you, and in this it quite succeeds.</p>

<p>We reached the Post <i>bureau</i> of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Moritz at 11.30,
and started at once for Pontresina, the Australian
having shouldered my <i>sac</i>, or—to be accurate—having
taken it in his hand, for from a feeling of self-respect
he would never shoulder it in a town, lest this method
of carrying it might lead to the degrading inference
that he was a professional. The walk was a pleasant
one of about four miles down to and across the Inn,
along the lake side, and through woods and meadows.
I was just in time to save my engagement. Of course
everybody knows that time was made for slaves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
but sometimes it is pleasant to be punctual, for
instance when a long business, subject throughout to
a variety of circumstances, has been brought to a
close at a prearranged moment, for then you may
fancy that it is you who are master of time and of
yourself.</p>

<p>As I parted with the Australian he was sufficiently
professional to ask for more than he had
agreed to serve me for plus the present I added to
the agreement. This demand I did not decline to
comply with, for had I not now reached my destination
for the time with some treasure of memorable
sights and of pleasant thoughts for myself, and how
could our journeyings benefit him except in this way
of francs? And why by withstanding his request for
more should I ruffle my companion, or be ruffled
myself? Besides, too, in our last four miles I had
begun to think him less burdensome, or more
tolerable, than he had appeared to me at any time
previously. In those four miles he had again, as he
had frequently done on other occasions (but as now I
was about to see him no more the incongruity seemed
rather amusing than shocking) called the ravines
gullies, the forest bush, my <i>sac</i> the swag, and the
glaciers—how horrible, but how explicable in such a
circumnavigator—the icebergs! And so after all we
parted amicably, as it is best that people should, and
with reciprocal expressions of good wishes for each
other’s welfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>Pontresina consists of a long narrow street. At its
northern extremity, by which those arriving from the
Engadin enter it, the first building you pass is one of
its two large hotels. The other is at its southern extremity.
A few hundred yards beyond this is a
second little town, Upper Pontresina, with its hotel.
The two will soon be united into one long unbroken
street of about a mile in length. This street is
crowded at most hours of the day. There are people
returning from their forenoon excursions, and others
starting for their afternoon excursions. People
arriving from, or leaving for the near towns of the
Engadin, or from or for Italy by the Bernina Pass.
After the early dinner, which had regulated my
movements throughout the forenoon, and indeed for
some days back, my wife and her little boy took me
in hand, to introduce me to the sights of the place.
‘There is the Roseg valley, and the Roseg glacier,
with such and such peaks above it.’ These could be
seen from Pontresina. ‘We will take you there to-morrow.
This afternoon we will go along the main
valley, and give you a look at the Morterasch.’ And
that was what they did. The road, like the street,
only in a less degree, was alive with parties coming
and going, for it is not only the way to the Morterasch
and Bernina, but also the route to Italy by
Poschiavo and Tirano. The evening was closing in
when we returned to Pontresina. The crowd in the
single street had now in the neighbourhood of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
Post <i>bureau</i> become almost a block. In the crowd I
met an Englishman I had seen in the morning at
Casaccia. His air was distracted. He had been for
some time in search of a place to shelter him for the
night, but was everywhere told the same story, that
his search would be hopeless: even every landing and
passage in every private house, where a shake-down
could be placed, was already bespoken.</p>

<p>Bewildering was the stir in the narrow street. There
were many Germans, but the English including the
Americans, or as they might put it, the Americans
including the English, were largely in the majority.
The peculiarity of the crowd was that it included
many children, and almost as many ladies as gentlemen.
What was it that had brought together this
concourse of people from many nations, and even from
the New World? It was simply to see glaciers.
The glaciers had been there from time before history,
from the time, it may be, that man had trod the soil
of Europe: it is scarcely, however, a dozen years
since such crowds began to assemble here to see
them. This indicates new thoughts and new sentiments
about the world we live in, as well as an
increase of wealth and of facilities for locomotion. It
was never so seen of old times. In our fathers’ times
men and women flocked to London and Paris, as they
had done in the old world to Rome, to see and to be
seen. Society was the great attraction. For a little
time a few had been attracted to Athens, because it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
was the centre of art, of culture, and of refinement,
but that was a dawn of promise that was soon overcast.
For some thousand years before that dawn
so soon obscured, the greatest annual gatherings of
men had been at Egyptian Thebes. The object,
however, which had brought them together there had
been the exchange of the commodities of Asia and of
Africa. The attraction was first commerce, then
social dissipation. Here men are brought together in
a lofty Alpine valley, too cold to grow a potato,
where there is no trade, and no society, to see mountains
and glaciers. This is a higher, because a purely
intellectual, purpose. In the first gatherings of the
young world only one class of men took part,
merchants and traders. In the next mainly those
who had riches and nothing to do. Here we have,
without excluding the rich, men of all professions,
mostly not rich, and many of them with plenty to do.
They come in multitudes; and the cry is still, ‘they
come,’ that is in yearly increasing multitudes.</p>

<p>But the impulse that has carried the world to
Pontresina, will not stop at Pontresina. At no distant
day the children of these summer-tourists, when locomotion
shall have been still further improved, will
cross oceans for their summer excursions, and will
climb the Andes, and the Himalaya, as their children
may the Mountains of the Moon, going perhaps
by the Soudan railway we now hear is in contemplation,
and taking the sources of the Nile by the way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
People will not for ever, now that they have begun to
look out on the world, be content with the moderate
altitudes, and the sombre, monotonous pine woods of
central Europe. The appetite for seeing nature is
one that grows with what it feeds on. Those who
have found pleasurable emotions result from seeing
Switzerland will wish to see something more of this
glorious world. They will long to become acquainted
with grander mountain ranges, with nobler and more
diversified faunas and floras than those of our temperate
zone, and with other conditions and forms of
human life than those which obtain among a portion
of our near kindred circumstanced not very dissimilarly
from ourselves.</p>

<p>The history of the recent spread of the love now
so widely felt for nature is interesting and instructive.
Clearly it had its rise in that increase in the knowledge
of nature which belongs to our times. It is,
however, obvious that it is not confined to those who
have this knowledge in the form and degree which
would entitle it to be regarded as scientific. They
are few, but the desire is felt by many, almost, indeed,
by all who have received any culture worthy of the
name. It seems, therefore, to have spread from the
few to the many by a kind of infection, which shows
that it is a natural taste, which former conditions
kept in a state of repression. From what we see we
may conclude that the acquisition and possession
of the images and ideas, which the contemplation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
or if that is too strong a word for the case of those
who have been debarred from any scientific acquaintance
with nature, then which the mere sight of the
forms and phenomena of nature supplies to the mind,
is a source of delight. Of course, the delight would
be far greater, had the previous knowledge been
wider and deeper, that is to say had the mind been
better fitted for the reception of the images and ideas;
but still it is felt, and so strongly as to give rise to a
desire for more extended fields of observation. Even
in old times there are indications of this pleasure
having been felt. It was not absent from the awe
and wonder which accompanied the observation of
the starry firmament, and of the phenomena of the
great deep, or from the attempt to co-ordinate the
details of the natural scene as depicted in the
hundred and fourth Psalm. Solomon’s collection of
facts and observations about animals and plants—for
his works on these subjects must have been something
of this kind—was suggested by this pleasure. And
as these emotions had such issues among the ancient
Hebrews, we cannot suppose that their kindred
neighbours were strangers to them. We know, too,
that by the Greeks and Romans they were still more
strongly felt. From these early observations and impressions,
accompanied by pleasurable emotions, as
from a small germ, but one that was full of vital
power, has arisen the distinctly aimed effort to grasp
in one intelligible whole all the phenomena and forces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
of nature, and all the forms of life the world has to
show us. What was long ago dimly divined is now
clearly understood that the world, and all it contains,
are very good; that precisely it, and nothing else is
the great external gift of God to man—man’s great
inheritance; and that it is only by seeing it, and
understanding it, that he can enter on the possession
of it: for there is no other way in which he can make
it his own.</p>

<p>But the picture which the world presents to us for
contemplation is not composed merely of land and
water, ranging through different zones, with their
respective floras and faunas, and physical phenomena:
the soul of the picture is the observer himself—man;
not the individual observer, but the race. Man it is
that imparts dramatic life and interest to the picture.
Not that this globe is without a progress, that is a
history, of its own. It has that, but its history is
devoid of the highest element of interest, that is the
moral element. It is by viewing the world in connexion
with man that the picture becomes invested
with this, the highest source of interest. And if an
extended view of the world, inclusive of man’s place
in it, and relation to it, be taken, whether the extension
be in the direction of space, or of time, it will be
seen in each view with equal clearness—and the inference
from one view proves and confirms the inference
from the other, for they are identical—that in the
long drama of human history it is increase in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
knowledge of nature which has led to increase in
man’s dominion over nature, and it is increase in his
dominion over nature which has led on to, and given
rise to, those conditions which have resulted in a
richer and higher moral life.</p>

<p><i>August 11.</i>—At 8.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> got under weigh for the
Roseg glacier, piloted by my two new guides. The
morning was bright, the air quiet and fresh, and
everything level to their wish that what they had to
show might be seen to the best advantage. As you
turn your back on Pontresina, and cross the rocky
channel of the Bernina Bach, which carries off the
outflow of the eastern and northern sides of the
Bernina group, you command the upward view of
the valley of the Roseg. It is not of the narrow
ravine kind, but has some little space of wooded
bottom, generally open enough to afford a little
pasturage. You are 6,000 feet above the sea; the
forest, therefore, is composed of larch and cembra.
On either side are grand mountains. The western<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
is steeper than the eastern wall, and is still in the
morning sun. The eye ranges over the valley to rest
on the great snow-field at its head, which commences
its rise at a distance from you of six miles. It is of
the purest white, and this is not to any great extent
scarred and broken by protruding rocks and summits,
for the naked rock faces of its ridges look not in this,
but in the opposite, or southern, direction. It closes
the head of the valley, and is a wide field that satisfies
the eye with its amplitude of expansion, its pure
white, and its majestic rise to the sky-line.</p>

<p>A walk of five miles through the forest brings you
to a little plain, which is evidently the site of an old
lake long since filled up with glacier <i>débris</i>. At the
near end of this is a little inn, kept by a little Frenchman,
who will talk to you about the empire, the
commune, and the republic, but with some reserve.
At the further end, about half a mile off, is the foot
of the glacier. My guides, in the exercise of a wise
discretion, did not take me upon the glacier itself,
but by a path along the flank of Piz Corvatsch, for
about a mile or more, to a very commanding position,
a little beyond the <i lang="fr">châlet</i> of the alpe. This point,
which is sufficiently above the glacier, is opposite to
a dark protruding eminence in it, yclept Agagliouls,
below which its two main ice-streams meet. And here,
like the Lord Thomas and fair Annet of the ballad we
sat a while on a hill. They sat all day; and when
night was come, and sun was set, they had not talked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
their fill. We, not having the excuse they had for
being forgetful of time, after half an hour began to
retrace our steps, though we had hardly looked our
fill. Still we had looked enough to be able to carry
away with us a mental picture, that might be recalled
at will, of the topography and aspects of the grand
scene—the widespread uptilted snowfield, and its
component parts, and the named summits, and their
relations to each other, and respective effects on the
whole, and upon the glacier in particular, which is
the outcome of the whole. A peculiarity of this scene
is its bounded completeness. It does not in any
direction suggest the infinite, as it might if you were
on a central, or commanding eminence, with snowy
heights all around you, reaching away to distant
horizons. It has near, definite boundaries. You
seem to take in the whole of it, when it is looked at
from our to-day’s point of observation; and when
looked at from Pontresina, as all other objects are
there excluded from your view, the effect is almost
that of a picture set in a frame. One marked feature
of the scene, from our point of observation on Piz
Corvatsch, is the lofty, precipitous, slate-coloured,
<i>couloir</i>-streaked Piz Tschierva, with its dark hanging
glaciers. It bounds our snowfield on the north.</p>

<p>As we returned we made a requisition for our
dinner on the resources of the expatriated Parisian,
the victim of political instability. It was verging
towards evening, when, after a day of pleasant loitering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
we again found ourselves at Pontresina. The
greater part of the evening I spent in a long discussion
with the head of one of the old patroon families
of what was once New Amsterdam, and is now New
York, on the suitableness, or the reverse, of the
principle of free trade to the present industrial condition
of the United States. Of course the logic of
neither had any effect on the other.</p>

<p><i>August 12.</i>—Out at a few minutes before 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
We contemplated the ascent of the Piz Languard,
and whatever else the day might admit of our doing.
The masons and carpenters employed in building on
our side of the road a large new hotel, and on the
opposite side a <i>dépendance</i> to the existing hotel, were
already seated around on pieces of timber, and heaps
of stones, waiting for the moment when they were to
commence the labours of the day. The horse that
was to carry the little man as far as the foot of the
cone, and the guide we had engaged for the day,
arrived as we were emerging from the door of
President Saratz’s house, in which we had been so
fortunate as to obtain our lodgings, and we were
started by the clock of the church across the street
striking the hour. Upper Pontresina was soon passed
by our taking a short cut up to the forest through a
prairie or two, from which the hay had just been
carried. The ascent may be roughly divided into
three stages, each requiring about an hour. The
first is through the forest, and is somewhat toilsome.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
The second lies beyond the trees, and is about an
hour more of open, rocky, bleak, not steep Alpine
pasture, along and up the valley of the Languard.
Then an hour of stiff climbing up the cone by a
grandly irregular mountain staircase. Here steps
have been made in the rock, here slabs of rock have
been fixed for steps, here an impracticable rock so
barred the way that the path had to take half the
circuit of it before the staircase could again ascend.
All this is on a perfectly naked, precipitously steep
incline—truly the side of a mountain cone.</p>

<p>The summit which is sufficiently level affords
standing and sitting space for perhaps half a dozen
parties. There might have been as many upon it
before we left it. It is composed of huge blocks and
slabs of rock tossed together in disorder, but so as to
give many natural seats, and some shelter from wind.</p>

<p>But what of the view? On this morning it was
not seen to the most advantage. There were clouds
rising from many of the valleys; and these, though
they were neither continuous, nor fixed, interfered
much with the view, for they obliged us to watch for
an opportunity for seeing all that was to be seen in
any direction, and made it throughout impossible to
see the whole panorama connectedly at a single
glance round. In time, however, we managed to see
the whole in detail, so as to be able to put it together
in the mind. The view takes its character very much
from that of the region. It is the peculiarity of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
region, as compared with other great mountain
districts of Switzerland, that, while the mountain tops
are not so lofty as elsewhere, the valleys are far
loftier. For instance, the Finster-Aarhorn rises to
an altitude of 14,026 feet, Monte Rosa of 15,364,
Mont Blanc of 15,781, but the Piz Bernina, the
loftiest of the surrounding heights, rises only to an
altitude of 13,294. And if the small group to which
the Piz Bernina belongs be excepted, the height of
but few of the summits of the encircling ranges is
greater than the 10,715 of the Piz Languard itself,
that is to say of your point of view. And as to the
valleys: while Interlaken is depressed to 1,863 feet,
Brieg to 2,244, and Chamouni to 3,445, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Moritz and
Campfer, the only points in the valley of the Engadin
visible from our observatory, do not descend below
6,000 feet. Here, therefore, we have to look at a
ring of lower mountains springing from a far higher
level. The consequence of this is that they have not
sufficient altitude to develop any very marked peculiarities
of form. This will be seen at a glance by
comparing any part of the panorama of this view
with any other: the two will resemble each other
very closely. And if the whole view be compared
with that from the Gorner Grat, the Eggischhorn,
or the Rigi, its general sameness will be again perceived.
What we here have is a multitude of apparently
small summits, a large proportion of which
are snow-capped, but none of which are distinctly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
featured; and they all appear to be at about our own
level. The effect is almost the same as that of an
agitated sea, the waves of which are of about the
same height, and many of them crested with foaming
white. The only exception to this is the Bernina
group close by, into which you look: but even here
the summits which stand out of the snowfield appear
to have no striking varieties of form. There are no
Wetterhorns and Shrekhorns, and Finster-Aarhorns,
no Weisshorns and Matterhorns among them. What
in this group is really grand, and which we saw well
to-day, is that the whole of the snowfield that is
visible from right to left, and from above, converges
to the Morterasch glacier. There is in this the unity
of a picture. It is held up to you who are on the
Piz Languard, to be looked at, just as a picture might
be, and just at the right distance for taking in the
details of such a picture. It has the completeness,
limitation and definiteness, which, from this side,
belong to views of this group. And, too, its pure
field of unsullied white, contrasts well with the dark
rusty brown of the cliffs and ravines immediately
around and below you, which are themselves one of
the most striking and interesting features of this view
from the Piz Languard. They are the foreground,
and have an impressive and awe-inspiring aspect.
Beyond them, all round the horizon, excepting the
Bernina group, is the ocean of petrified waves, many
crested with petrified foam. Just in one place an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
opening enables you to look down on <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Moritz and
Campfer, the only point in the vast panorama, at
which you can find a trace of man, and of his works—all
the rest is but mountain summits innumerable,
a world to the utmost horizon of rock and snow.</p>

<p>In descending the cone, you may find near the
foot of it a low inconspicuous signboard, not two
feet out of the ground, as if it had been intended that
it should escape observation. On it is inscribed the
word Bormio. The little man, who, during his stay
at Pontresina, had been constructing in his mind a
map of the neighbourhood, knew very well what this
meant. It pointed in the direction of the Pischa Pass
to the Val del Fain. There below us, to the left, was
the Western spur of the snowfield of the Pass; and
snow appears to have an irresistible attraction for
youthful minds, as it has also for feminine in the Alps.
A debate, therefore, instantly commenced whether it
would not be better to take to the snow. In this
debate I did not join, in order that the other members
of the party might decide for themselves according to
their own wishes, and their own estimates of their
own powers. I had, however, no doubt of what the
decision would be. It took but a little moment to
arrive at it; and then we turned our backs on
Pontresina, and made for the snow. First we had to
get to the bottom of the valley: that was quickly done;
and then to ascend it to the snow over blocks and
fragments of rock, each of which was as clean as if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
had been boiled in caustic lye. They were also so
tightly jammed together, that you might walk a
hundred yards, or more, upon them without one
slipping, or so much as moving, under your feet.
How came they to be of so clean a surface, and so
tightly fixed together? They are clean because there
is little up here to soil them—no dirt, no dust; and
being buried deeply in winter and spring under the
snow, there is not much chance for lichens to form
upon them; and whatever soil, or stain, might commence
to adhere to them, is washed away when the
snow is melting in the spring. And as to their being
so firmly fixed together, I believe that is a consequence
of their being every year rammed together by
a rammer, that has to a London paviour’s the ratio of
Nasmyth’s steam-hammer to a blacksmith’s. And
this rammer that is brought into operation here is
that of the avalanches that break away from the
overhanging heights. They fall on these streams and
beds of fragments of rock with hundred ton blows,
compressing and jamming them together, when the
blow is direct, and, when they slide, sweeping off the
pieces that cannot be infixed in the compacted mass.</p>

<p>After the clean macadamized rocks came the snow:
first about three-quarters of a mile of gradual ascent;
and then, when the actual Pass was reached, a steep
incline of snow up the mountain on the right, and on
the left a more level field on a lower stage. The two
were separated by a kind of ridge of snow about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
250 yards long. A slip from this to the lower stage
would have been easy, and might have been serious:
there was, however, footing enough on the ridge, if
only you would look where you were going to set
your foot, and not at the lower snowfield. From this
we stepped off to a glacier on our right; the glacier
of the Val del Fain, or Heuthal. It is of no great
length, and is uncrevassed, but has rather too great
an incline for direct descent: we, therefore, took it
diagonally. The stream from the glacier is not seen
to issue from it, but as you walk over the stream of
rocks, that continues the stream of ice, you hear the
stream of water rushing by beneath your feet. The
books I see say that this is a Pass for experienced
mountaineers; I should rather say that, when it is as
it was this day, it is a charming bit for lady beginners,
who have got so far as to know that they can,
under not very trying circumstances, trust to their
feet and heads.</p>

<p>Having left the glacier you find yourself in a
depressed area of some little extent surrounded with
jagged summits, on which, wherever it can find a lodgment,
snow is resting. The central area is not flat, but
composed of knolls and pools. As we were standing
on one of these knolls—it had a flattened top—noticing
how hard, and cold, and dead, was everything around
us, we espied at our feet, growing here and there on
the scaly rubble on which we were treading, several
plants of the <i>Aretia Glacialis</i>. To find unexpectedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
upon such a surface, and with such surroundings, so
charming a form of life could not but give a little
thrill of pleasure. Each plant was a compact round
patch of mossy foliage, singularly even and smooth,
and firmly set together, perhaps half an inch high,
and two or three inches in diameter. Out of this little
green cushion stood up about a dozen, or more, little
pearl-coloured stars, not in one cluster, or in several,
but each star singly on its own stem. The pearl-coloured
stars were interspersed with some that were
of a waxy white. The pearl-colour was the hue of
youth, freshness, and vigour; the white told of age
and incipient decay. This discovery led to our looking
about for something more; and our search was
rewarded, for on the next knoll we found several tufts—that
is the shape it assumes up here—of the golden
dwarf <i>Papaver Pyrenaicum</i>. These two lovely plants
did not on this day waste their beauty on the desolate
scene. Their flowers are now gone, and they are
themselves buried in snow; but what they were on
that August day still lives in the mind. The little
pearly stars, and the golden cups, have still an
existence. Their form and colour, now that they are
creatures of the brain, are the same as they were while
they were expanded on the shaly knoll, protruded
through the snow, on the top of the Pischa, quickened
by the warmth, and drinking in the light, of the sun
that was smiling on them. There, too, in the brain,
they must have some substance, for creatures of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
brain must be of the substance of the brain.
The difference is that now they exist in another
medium, and are cognisable by another sense; but in
that new medium they still have their original form
and colour, and still possess the power of giving
pleasure.</p>

<p>If then any lady beginner in Alpinism shall have
been brought here by a desire to add to her Alpine
mementos these two plants (I left them undisturbed),
gathered after such a walk, and on such a spot; she
will find, after she has secured her mementos, that
what she has next to do is to effect her descent into
the Val del Fain. The first stage of the descent
will be found somewhat steep, and very incoherent.
We, having done this piece, and reached the turf-grown
side of the mountain, instead of continuing straight
down into the valley below, along the bottom
of which lies the path to the Bernina House (not the
Hospice), descended the flank of the long mountain
diagonally from the point where we first came out on
its side all the way to the Bernina House. It is worth
while to take the Val del Fain in this fashion, because,
although it may give you somewhat rougher work, the
added amount of rougher work will be repaid tenfold
by the astonishing variety of beautiful flowers you will
see on the mountain flank. The stations, as botanists
call them, vary much, the ground being sometimes
wet, and sometimes dry, sometimes good and deep,
and sometimes shallow and stony. Indeed, this valley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
is celebrated for its flowers; and I am acquainted
with no other in which they may be found in greater
variety and profusion. As we approached the Bernina
House—about half a mile from it—the air was loaded
with perfume. The <i>Edelweiss</i> abounds on these ridges.
Some days back, my two unprofessional Pontresina
guides had found many specimens of it up the valley,
only at a point further up than we were to-day.
While we were at dinner at the Bernina House our
professional guide ascended in search of it the dark
cliffs at the back of the house, beyond the stream, and
was not long in returning with a large <i>bouquet</i>.</p>

<p>The dinner just mentioned we had earned, for we
had been on the move since 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, and in that time
had ascended the Piz Languard, and crossed La
Pischa. Nor was the dinner unequal to such antecedents;
for it consisted of trout, beefsteaks, Poschiavo
potatoes, Valtelline wine, <i lang="fr">omelette aux confitures</i>, a
<i>compote</i> of pears, and cream at discretion. The charge
for this for three persons, was 9 francs, 20 cents. I
give these particulars because it is a kind of ingratitude,
when you have been treated well at an inn, not
to have a word to say upon the subject. After you
have paid your bill, the only way in which you can
encourage well-doing of this kind, and make a return
for the good services by which you have been benefited,
is to make them known.</p>

<p>We now set our faces towards Pontresina—somewhat
more than 5 miles distant. Our way lay along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
the excellent Bernina post-road. At about a mile, or
a little more, from the inn we were abreast of the falls
of the Bernina. As the rest of the party knew the
road well, having this summer, and last, made many
excursions along it, I here left them to find their
way home, while I diverged from the road to see the
falls, and to get a near view of the lower part of the
Morteratsch glacier. As to the falls: the rocks over
and upon which the stream tumbles being in unusually
large blocks and slabs, and of a dark colour,
and the tumbling water being much broken, and in
consequence very white, and the overhanging larch
being of a tender green, make them a favourite bit with
painters, and on this sunny day there were several
easels beside them. As to the glacier: it has a very
distinctive character. The point of view from which I
was now looking at it was a rock just above the last
trees on the mountain side. Here it has the appearance
of descending by a rapid and short course (in
fact, however, it has a descent of 7 miles), from the
snow-clad ridges above you, which, as seen from this
point, do not appear of commanding elevation, nor do
they present any very distinguishing features. The
characteristics of the glacier are its breadth and
massiveness. At the point I took for viewing it, its
eastern half was hid from sight by an enormous
central <i>moraine</i>. As I afterwards saw from the road
this enormous <i>moraine</i> assumed on the lower part of
the glacier the form of a Brobdingnagian Ray or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
Skate, with its tail upwards, and its broad shoulders
just reaching to the termination of the glacier. As
you continue your contemplation of the scene, you
may fancy that you are taking in at a few glances the
whole life and history of the glacier, from its first
beginnings on those heights, throughout its course
opposite to where you are seated, and down to its
termination at the head of the small filled-up lake
you crossed, as you were coming up through the wood
below you. As to its termination at the head of the
old filled-up lake, that alone is well worth turning out
of the road to see; for this is not a glacier which
thins out, and dies away feebly, as the fashion of
some is, but is one of those which end grandly and
abruptly: few, indeed, more so, for it emphasizes the
conclusion of its course with perpendicular ice-cliffs
some 200, or more, feet high. This near view I have
been speaking of must necessarily be very incomplete,
but you will to some extent be able to supplement
its incompleteness by what you will see of the glacier
from the road, and by the general survey of it you
will take from the top of the Piz Languard.</p>

<p>I got back to Pontresina at 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, having been
out twelve hours. This may seem a long day to those
who are killing themselves by their sedentary habits.
But if a lady, and a child who had not yet numbered
as many years as these hours, could go through it
without suffering that amount of fatigue which is
implied by the expression of ‘being knocked up,’ we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
may be sure that a great many of those who might
pronounce it beyond their powers, would be very well
able to do it; and would be all the better for a month’s
excursion, which would give them such a day once a
week. Such a month every year might perhaps add
a dozen years to their lives, and enable them to do
each year a great deal more than they will ever
otherwise be equal to, and to do it better.</p>

<p>Our guide of this day was a young man by trade
a carpenter. He told us that it was his intention, in
accordance with the Grison custom, to go abroad for
some years. His plans were already arranged. At
the end of the summer he was to start for Chicago,
where he understood that a great deal of building was
going on. He hoped that he should be able to make
and save some money, and, while so employed, to
learn English; with which money and language he
further hoped in some half dozen years to return to
Pontresina. How strangely do things come about,
and combine! Here we have a Grison peasant going
to the New World to learn English, and a fire in a
town on the border of Lake Michigan, at a spot where,
in the memory of people still living, the buffalo
quenched his thirst, creating for him an opening for
going. But, then, this peasant can read and write,
and so can his neighbours: had it been otherwise, he
never would have comprehended the advantages, or
imagined the possibility, of his learning English; and
never would have known anything about Chicago,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
and its fires; much less have been able to plan how
he might turn the possibilities of the place to his own
account. And this is only a particular instance of a
wide general fact. The whole world is now in a very
practical sense becoming the stage for the activity of
all who are capable of doing its work; and in every
field those who are better qualified will push aside
those who are not so well qualified. For a long time
this has been exemplified by the Scotch. Scotchmen
were to be found not only in every large town in
England, but in India, China, the West Indies, and
more or less all over the world. So is it now beginning
to be with the Germans. They are spreading
themselves over the whole of the commercial world.
They are to be found in this country, and in all
countries, wherever any business is to be transacted.
The reason is again the same. Germany is not
favoured by nature with a rich soil, with any great
variety of produce, or with good harbours: what is
giving its people so large a share in the business of
the world is that they have endeavoured to fit themselves
for it. And in these days of general intercommunication,
and of inexhaustible supplies of
capital, nations follow the same rule as individuals.
The nation that has become better qualified than
others for producing anything the world requires, will
take the place of those who have not kept themselves
up to the mark. If its people have the other requisite
qualifications they will never find any difficulty about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
commanding the requisite capital; for it is they who
will be able to employ it most profitably, and it is for
profitable employment that capital exists. All the
world is now open to all the world, and the principle
of the selection of the fittest, which Mr. Darwin tells
us rules among plants and the lower animals, will
assign its place to each nation, as it does to a great,
and ever increasing, extent to individuals. If it be a
law of nature, it must be universal and without
exemptions.</p>

<p>At Pontresina everybody complains of the dearness
of everything. The hotel-keepers endeavour to
persuade the grumblers among their guests that this
comes of its being a place that produces nothing but
milk and a scanty allowance of fuel. This is not
the cause of the high prices. London, which has to
provide for a million more mouths than the whole of
the Swiss Confederation, does not produce even the
milk and the fuel. Much of its bread is brought
from California, Oregon, and the Antipodes. Much
of its meat comes from Scotland and the Continent;
and so with everything it consumes. The supplies,
however, of Pontresina are drawn from central
Switzerland and northern Italy—no great distances.
I saw in its long street hucksters’ carts, which had
been dragged up from the Valtellina and the Bregaglia
by the wretched animals then between the
shafts. These carts were full of the most perishable
kinds of fruit, which were being retailed by the men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
who had brought them, and who would soon be back
again with another venture of the same kind: here,
as everywhere else in the world, whatever is wanted
is sure to come. The true reason of the high prices
is one which would not sound well in the mouths of
those who are naturally, and not reprehensibly, profiting
by them: it is that scores of people more than the
hotels can accommodate, apply for accommodation
every day in the season. For every bedroom there are
many applicants of this kind. The one, therefore, to
whom it is assigned, is glad to have it, as each of the
rejected applicants would have been, at rather a high
price. It is the same with guides, horses, and
carriages; the people who are anxious to secure
them are out of all proportion to the supply. Every
market is practically a kind of auction; and at an
auction no one thinks it wrong that there should be
much competition, or that there should be little.
Here we have much competition, in consequence of
the supply being very much in arrear of the demand.
This is a matter which time will set right. President
Saratz’s new hotel, to be opened next year, will do a
little towards trimming the balance. It will be under
the management of his son, whom he kept in London
for two years to learn English, and to make him a
Master of Arts in hotel-keeping. The Charing Cross
Hotel was the college in which he pursued these
studies.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that I saw this year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
more birds in the Grisons than I had ever seen before
elsewhere in Switzerland. To those who take an interest
in ornithology, the President will readily show
a collection of the birds of the canton, made by himself.
He has well set-up specimens of a great many
species. As might be expected from the altitude of
the valleys our English species do not figure largely
among them. He has besides, in a room in the basement
of his house, two living specimens of the noble
rock eagle—the Stein Orteler. These, I believe, he
intends to add to his collection as soon as they shall
have attained their full adult plumage. In his
younger days he was a successful chamois-hunter,
and he has preserved the heads of more than thirty
of these antelopes as trophies of his prowess.</p>

<p>But to go back for a moment to the high prices
now ruling at Pontresina. They press hard on the
peasants. None of them have, or ever had, superfluities
enough of cheese, and of potatoes and rye-flour
purchased with their surplus cheese, the fruits
of very hard work, and a bare sufficiency of fuel, with
no margin for reduction in anything, was pretty well
all that in the general distribution of the good things
of this world fell to them. And now the prices of
these necessaries of life, and of the few other things
they may be obliged to purchase, have been greatly
raised against them, first by the general rise of
prices everywhere, and then by the local causes of a
great increase in the permanent population of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
neighbourhood, and of the large summer influx of
visitors, who are, as respects the peasants, merely a
flight of locusts, that in their passage eat up everything.
As, then, a Pontresina peasant, after maintaining
his family from the produce of his little plot of
ground, can have very little surplus to sell, it is evident
that, if he cannot make his house fit for lodging
visitors, or obtain some share in the new, highly-paid
summer employments, his life must be much harder
than it was before. To him that the world now
comes to Pontresina is the reverse of a gain.</p>

<p><i>August 13.</i>—After breakfast walked to <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Moritz
to replenish the fisc. As English sovereigns were
reckoned at twenty-five francs only—the Swiss Post-office
allows twenty cents more per sovereign on
money orders from England—I did not understand,
nor have I since learnt, why I was asked to pay for
the transaction the little commission of two francs
and a half.</p>

<p>Having returned to Pontresina I went to the
Post <i>bureau</i> to despatch some heavy luggage to Lausanne.
In the middle of the business, while the
clerk was engaged in weighing the pieces, a German
pushed his way through the crowd, and interrupting
the business in hand, without a word of apology, took
possession of the clerk. I once saw at Interlaken
another gentleman of the same nationality act in precisely
the same fashion. The action exactly corresponded—the
comparison must be excused for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
sake of its illustrative aptness—to that of a pig, who
having come up to the feeding-trough a little late,
instantly knocks aside those who are already in possession,
and setting his forefeet in the dish, gulps
down all he can. The German pig, however, goes
further than this, for he plants himself lengthways in
the narrow dish, so that the first comers who have
been knocked aside, can have no more till he is satisfied.
On both of these occasions the clerk submitted
without remonstrance. I have also seen managers of
hotels accept with equal meekness German animadversions
long and loud on items in their bills, which
I cannot but suppose they would have resented had
they come from Frenchmen or Englishmen. Why
this difference? Is it because the Swiss are used to
this kind of Tudesque violence? Has much experience
taught them at last that there is nothing
for it but to wait till the storm has exhausted itself?
Or is it because they are afraid of it? And, then, of
these barbarians; as all the world knows that Germans
are for the most part easy, good-natured, reasonable
people, to what class do they belong? Are they
junkers? Or are they specimens of the Allemanic
variety of the <i>nouveaux riches</i>? Do they belong to
the shopocracy, or to the Bureaucracy, or to the
barrack? Do they come from Berlin, or from the
Hercynian Forest?</p>

<p>This was my last day at Pontresina. My little
guide had now to return to the college of Lausanne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
where he would have to put in his appearance on the
15th. It was now the 13th. He, therefore, and his
mother, must leave to-night by the 4 A.M. diligence.
I would join them at Lausanne, but at present it was
too soon for me to return; and so I determined to go
by some cross-country way to the Stelvio and to the
Ortler; and when I had reached Trafoi to think about
where I would go next. My own idea for the start
was to take the lakes Nero and Bianco on the way to
Poschiavo; and then by Val di Campo, and Val
Viola, to get to Bormio. But Christian Grass, a name
well known in Pontresina, whom I had engaged to
accompany me, was quite sure that I should find
more to interest me if I went by the way of the Stretta
to Livigno, and thence over M. della Neve, and by
Isolaccia, to Bormio. I was easily persuaded, for so
that we went I cared little what way we went. I
knew we could not go a bad way. His advice was,
that I should send on my <i>sac</i> to the Bernina House,
by the Post this afternoon, and walk there in the
evening; and then, at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to-morrow, by which
hour he would himself, having slept at home, arrive
from Pontresina, start for Livigno. As this was what
I had myself thought would be best, so soon as the
Livigno route had been decided on, I showed my
confidence in him by telling him I would act on his
advice.</p>

<p>About an hour before dark I reached the Bernina
House. There is a bit of wet ground, three or four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
acres in extent, between the House and the Bernina
Bach. It is completely levelled for cutting; but, as it
is swampy, it grows hardly anything but the large-leafed
dock, and other kinds of marsh-weeds. Still
its produce is of much use in a country where there
is no straw for littering cows, and horses. I now
found in it a gang of ten men at work, cutting the
weeds. Those who in these parts mow for wages,
are generally Italians; the native men being employed
on their own land, and in waiting in one way or
another on travellers; or, which comprises a considerable
proportion of the young men, have gone abroad
for a time to seek their fortune. The pay of these
itinerant haymakers, was, I found, two francs, seventy
cents a day. As they live almost exclusively on
polenta, they are able to save the greater part of their
wages. I asked one of them what they did in winter.
‘We go home,’ he replied, ‘and sleep like the
marmots.’</p>

<p>A heavy shower drove me from the field into the
house for the rest of the evening, for it soon became
continuous rain without any intermission of the patter
against the window. Under these circumstances, the
landlady, who was also a not inconsiderable landlord
proved a host as well as an obliging hostess. She
was never long together out of the room, always
having something fresh to tell about herself, the
people, the country, the summer and winter traffic of
the road, or something or other. The House is her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
own property. She has also between thirty and forty
thousand klafters of prairie, or grass land levelled and
irrigated for mowing, and fourteen cows. Fourteen
hundred klafters are about equal to an English acre.
I have already mentioned, as we found yesterday, that
the good woman treats her guests well in respect
both of what she gives them, and of what she takes
from them. The bedrooms, of which there are six,
are small but clean. They are over the stabling, on
the opposite side of the way.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>August 14.</i>—It rained all night. At 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Christian
Grass, true to time, arrived. At 10.15 the rain
having subsided to a drizzle, we started for Livigno.
Our road lay up the Heuthal. We had been out half
an hour when the sun finished off the attenuating
clouds, and we had a most charming day for our
walk. The marmots before us, and right and left of
us on the mountain sides, had come out from their
earths to salute, in their fashion, the return of ‘the
God of gladness.’ Their sharp short cries we heard
all around us. ‘That,’ said Christian, ‘is the barometer
of fine weather; as the descent of the chamois from
the mountain tops is of a coming storm.’ Who would
not have thought well of the man who put local observation
in such a form?</p>

<p>If one can be pleased with a long treeless valley,
marvellously full of flowers (though, indeed, they
abound more on the high flanks than in the bottom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
where the path lies), and with mountains that are
neither covered with snow, nor very rugged, he will
be more than satisfied with his five miles’ walk through
the Heuthal. All throughout it that admits of being
mown is assigned in lots to the burgers of Pontresina,
for hay-making: the rest is good Alpine summer
pasture. Of course, as in every Swiss valley, the
music of a hurrying stream accompanies you all the
way. Near the further end of it, you come on a little
shallow tarn. ‘What,’ you ask, ‘has created this
tarn in this place?’ Something must have excavated
it. It seems itself to put the question to you; ‘can
you tell how I came here?’ As I looked up to the
mountain that overhung it, that seemed to give the
answer. From its top down to the little tarn there
was a steep side, in fact an unchecked slide, if
reckoned vertically, of 2,000 feet. What enormous
masses, then, of snow, must at times, probably every
year, drop down to this very spot! Their momentum
must be suddenly checked, and expended, just where
the little tarn is. The expenditure of such a force
must have an effect. The little tarn is the effect.
Whatever in the soil is compressible must be compressed,
and whatever is expressible must be driven
out, by the blow. This is what the mountain seemed
to say in explanation of the existence of the tarn.
‘It is my work,’ quoth the mountain; ‘I excavated it.’</p>

<p>A little beyond the tarn, and on the same level
with it, you suddenly, without any preparation, find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
yourself on the top of a lofty mountain, with a deep
valley at your feet. In fact for the last five miles
you have been walking up the western declivity of this
mountain, without perceiving it, or giving it a thought,
and latterly, without being aware of it, you have been
walking on its summit; and now in a moment, you
come to the brow of the summit, and the eastern side
of the mountain, all but, as it seems to you now you
are looking down, a mountain-deep precipice, is at
your feet. One step more you think would roll you
down to the bottom of it. You slept last night at a
height of 6,735 feet. You are now on the summit of
the Pass, at a height of 8,143 feet. So gradual,
through your five miles’ walk up the valley, has been
your ascent. The peaks right and left of you are
2,000 feet higher, and the sight of them had assisted
in keeping the true character of your position out
of your thoughts. There in the deep valley of the
Spöl below you, into which you now have to descend,
lies your way to Livigno. The valley is at right
angles to what has hitherto been the direction of your
path.</p>

<p>Having got down to the valley we selected a
halting place just above the stream of the Spöl, and
below the brow of its bank. Here we were in the
sun, but out of the wind; and having seated ourselves
on the turf, with rocks for footstools, we spent three-quarters
of an hour about what we called our dinner.
We had breakfasted early, and had walked just enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
to make us hungry. It was a very pleasant three-quarters
of an hour. There was the bright, warm
sun, the pleasant sensations of its brightness and
warmth enhanced by the recollection of the cold, wet
morning; there was the green valley before us, with
a herd of cows grazing near, and a party of salt
carriers returning with their asses to Poschiavo; there
were the naked drab-coloured mountain-tops, three, or
more, thousand feet above us; there was the motion
and the music of the lively crystal stream, as it hurried
by over its rocky channel at our feet, near enough to
enable us to dip from it without rising, what we
wanted for diluting and cooling our wine, that we
might take it in long draughts; and then there was
for me the conversation of a companion, who I knew
was intelligent, and who also, I had every reason to
believe, was a man of good faith.</p>

<p>One source of pleasure in such a three-quarters of
an hour is the perception of its difference from your
ordinary life. There is a present sense of the long
thread that connects you with home. What is around
and before you is not all that is at the moment in the
mind’s eye. Even the seas, the lands, the cities, the
mountains that lie between are not altogether lost to
view. The images it may be of your East Anglian
Vicarage, and of all that you have lately seen between
it and this charming little halting place below the
brow of the bank, and just above the stream, of the
Spöl, are recalled to mind. That within you which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
thinks and feels is quickened into its own proper
life. The sense of life is the conscious enjoyment of
the powers of life. And here, as you sit at rest on
this sunny fresh-aired bank with so many senses
of body and of mind so pleasantly appealed to,
you have the sense of life abundantly—the sense of
a living mind in a living body.</p>

<p>The rest of our way was along a gentle, almost
unobserved descent; at times, as we passed along the
silted-up beds of old lakelets, quite on a level. The
rounded tops of most of the contiguous mountains
showed where the materials had come from to fill up
the lakelets. You see in thought the steps of the
process; the frost disintegrating the summits, and
the torrents from rain, and from melting snow, bringing
the particles and pieces down to the lakelets; and
then you see man appearing on the scene, and toiling
through the short summer in burying and removing
the fragments of rock that strewed the surface, and
levelling all with what soil he could find, to make a
bed for the carpet of turf over which you are walking,
and upon which you see that all the life in the detached
<i lang="fr">châlets</i> and hamlets you are passing, ultimately
rests: for here, that is the one means of supporting
life.</p>

<p>The valley down to Livigno is generally broad
and verdant. At 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we reached Livigno. It is
a large scattered village, perhaps a mile and a half
long. Its houses are old, or at all events most of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
have the appearance of age, for the cembra timber of
which they are built after some years of exposure
weathers to a rich black. This the people call sun-burning.
The place has three or four churches. On
a blocked-up window of one of these, I counted six
tiers of swallow’s nests. I saw here no gnats or
musquitoes. This numerous colony, therefore, must
be supported chiefly by the house-fly. The reason
why there are so many house-flies here, and elsewhere
in Switzerland, is that there are so many landed proprietors.
The valley is broad, and is divided into
little estates, each just big enough to support a single
family. The land can only be turned to account
through cows. Every house, therefore, in the long
village has a manure heap at, or beside, its door.
These manure heaps, one for each house, are coverts
and preserves for breeding flies. If this part of the
valley was in a single property, there would be but
one fly-preserve; as things now are, there is a series
of them a mile and a half long. The chain, then, of
conditions is as follows; a broad grassy valley at an
altitude of more than 6,000 feet; this is divided into
small properties; each of these is devoted exclusively
to the support of cows; the manure from each byre,
for the eight months the cows are under cover, is
heaped up at the door; these heaps are left festering
in the sun throughout the summer, for the land, the
hay not yet having been made, is not yet ready for
the manure, and the people are too busy to remove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
it; in these heaps, innumerable flies are bred, these
flies feed the martins that build on the blocked-up
church window nests six tiers deep. If the whole
valley were put into a few cheese farms, the reduction
in the number of flies, and so in the number of
martins, would correspond to the reduction in the
number of proprietors. The number of flies is in
correlation to the size of the landed properties.</p>

<p>The only attempt that I saw had been made in
Livigno to grow anything except grass was that by
the side of some half dozen houses in the village in
little enclosures of a few yards square, white turnips
and white-leafed beet had been sown. But in the
middle of August, the former had no tubers, and the
latter were very stunted. Some of the mountains
right and left of the village, a little below it, have a
peculiarity: those in the second range appear to
have mountains of black rock placed on the top of
what may be called the original mountain, in shape
somewhat like the naves of titanic cathedrals without
towers. One of these superimposed masses on the
left is especially well formed and grand.</p>

<p>It was 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> when we reached the inn. An hour
afterwards, the rain of the early morning returned. It
soon, as the temperature continued to fall, changed
into snow, which continued for thirty hours. This
was a severe test of the resources of the place. I had
heard that it was celebrated for trout. One might
of one’s self have supposed this, for we had for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
last 9 miles been walking by the side of a stream, the
water of which was nowhere too broken for fish. Of
course, therefore, we ordered trout for our supper,
which was to be served at 6 o’clock. The little inn
has two little parlours. In each of these we found a
party of card-players. The two parties were forthwith
placed in a single room, that the other might be
appropriated to the visitors. These card-players were
elderly men, they represented the class who had in
their younger days sought fortune in foreign cities,
and in the degrees which satisfied them had found
what they sought. They had now returned to Livigno
to live on meagre cheese, mummy beef when a great
occasion justified such an indulgence, and black bread,
with a trout or two I suppose now and then; to be
regarded as the aristocracy of the place; to spend a
large proportion of their evenings in playing at cards
for schnapps, and to lay their bones in the God’s acre
of one of the four above-mentioned churches. As we
stood at the door of the inn, looking at the falling
snow, and not forgetting that it was the middle of
August, I asked one of these elders, ‘What, when he
might have lived in comfort elsewhere, had induced
him to return to such a place?’ His reply was, ‘The
memory of one’s parents is a beautiful thing.’ I felt
ashamed of my question. I was rebuked, humiliated,
and silent. In a moment his sentiment so natural, or
if not, then something much better, so human, or
again if not, then something much better, so tender,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
so pleasing, was confronted by the recollection of the
brutality of the English wife-beater. What, I thought,
can account for this world-wide difference? Why is
this peasant’s mind in this wretched Alpine recess a
smiling garden, while had his lot been cast in smiling
England it might have been a howling, outrageous
wilderness? Can, I asked myself, can in the one case
the general diffusion of property, the great educator,
and the absence of it in the other, lead, through their
natural consequences, and effects, to these two so
widely opposite states of mind? Is this at the root
of the difference?</p>

<p>As there was no going outside the door, and as
the room assigned to us was, now that the snow had
been falling some time, uncomfortably cold, I went into
the kitchen for warmth, for company, and for something
to see. The arrangements of the ground floor
of the inn were as follows: the front door by which
you entered, opened, throughout the day it was never
closed, upon a hall about 25 feet long, and 18 wide.
On the right of this were the two parlours; they were
small square rooms, each with a small square window,
which had, as is usual in Grison <i lang="fr">châlets</i>, a strong
family resemblance to an embrasure, the object of this
unusual diminutiveness and peculiarity of form being
to keep out the cold. On the walls were a few
coloured prints on religious subjects, and a few photographs
of friends and relatives. Of these two parlours
the one nearest the front door was assigned to us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
the other to the card-players. Opposite to our parlour
was a small room without a window, strongly fortified
against frost. In this was sunk the well, which in
winter was the only source to the house for its supply
of water. Opposite the other parlour was the door of
the cellar. Next to the hall, this was the largest room
in the house. It was somewhat sunk in the ground,
and by placing the cow-house against it, and by other
devices, all available means for keeping out the frost
had been resorted to. It contained many vats,
hogsheads, and barrels of various sizes, which are
replenished each year, while the roads are still
passable, or so soon as they become passable, but
while there is no probability of the occurrence of some
of the few hot days of a Grison summer. The hall
has no window, and receives all its light from the front
door, which must therefore be left open except in very
severe weather, and from the embrasures of the two
parlours. Against the wall of the hall, between the
doors of the two parlours, stood a table, on which were
two or three black bottles accompanied by some little
glasses. This was the provision for supplying the
villagers with schnapps of distilled drinks. Opposite
to this table, against the opposite wall, between the
doors of the pump-room and of the cellar, was another
table, on which also were black bottles, but accompanied
with small tumblers. This was the provision
for those who preferred Valtelline wine to distilled
schnapps. At the further end of the hall was, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
right, the staircase to the bedroom floor; and to the
left of that, the entrance to the kitchen.</p>

<p>The kitchen had but one window, and that, again,
as it was in the embrasure style, admitted a very insufficient
amount of light, and that insufficiency was
minimized by the blackness with which nearly a century
of smoke had stained the ceiling and walls: for
in these wooden interiors whitewashing is unknown.
On a high stool on the right side of the fire, in the
chimney corner, sat the aged father of our host. His
hair was long, and as white as the snow that was
falling. He wore a kind of full dress, a swallow-tailed
coat, and knee-breeches, I suppose to indicate
that he no longer made any pretence to do any kind
of work. In front of the fire was the burly wife of
our host, preparing the coffee, and frying the fish.
The fuel used was the wood of the cembra. This is
so full of turpentine, that no sooner does a chip of it
touch the fire than it bursts into flame. It was by
the aid of these chips that the good woman from
time to time ascertained whether the milk was burning,
the coffee had come to the boiling point, and the
fish were frying to her satisfaction. Supposing that
her visitor had come to see how things were done at
Livigno, she took a large chip, and having touched
the fire with it, held it up before me in a blaze of
pure white flame, and said, ‘Behold a Livigno candle.’
‘Thanks, Signora,’ quoth the visitor, ‘I see that
bountiful nature has well supplied your wants.’ All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
the while the landlord, when not summoned to the
hall to pour out a glass of schnapps—the wine to-day
was seldom called for: it was too cold and damp for
such thin potations—was constantly coming in, and
standing by the good woman’s side, watching her
proceedings with deep, and generally silent, attention,
as the eyes of a maiden might watch the hand of her
mistress. He was not quite calmed by his reasonable
conviction that the result would be a triumph,
but he wished to have himself some share, however
small it might be, in producing that triumph; so he
would at times inquire, <i lang="la">sotto voce</i>, whether there was
anything he could do. Should she want any more
wood? Any more milk? He would now bring the
jugs for the coffee, and for the milk, and the dish for
the trout. He would now warm the plates.</p>

<p>At last it was time for us to leave the scene of
these preparations. The moment had arrived, when
all that could be done had been done for the coffee
and the trout. And now the good man’s turn had
come. No sense of social inferiority had he in serving
his guests. Indeed in Livigno, his function was
honourable, and conferred much distinction. He could
not have served his guests with more observance had
they come to his house direct from Paradise, for the
purpose of opening to him the gate of Paradise, as
soon as their supper should be finished. He was
quite sure that the gate would be opened; and gladness,
that stood in no need of words for its expression,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
filled his heart; but still something might depend, a
little, but still something possibly, on his attention,
and on the satisfaction his guests might receive from
their supper. And now the coffee, the trout, the
bread and cheese, and the butter are on the table at
which we take our places. For some minutes he
stands looking on in an attitude, and with an expression,
of attention, and of readiness to fetch anything
more that might be required. In his own thought he
was sure that everything was of the best; that everything
would go off well; that nothing had been forgotten;
but he would stay for a few minutes to be
assured of this by his visitors from that higher and
better world. The assurance was given him; and he
left the room, as if loath to go, but with his whole
face beaming with the light that will suffuse the faces
of those, who have heard the blessed words that have
opened for them the gates of Paradise.</p>

<p>In all this, as we found the next morning, there
was nothing assumed. It was his natural manner and
disposition; only schnapps have the power of bringing
out, and of making predominant over everything
else, a man’s natural temper and disposition. Schnapps
reveal the true character. Through them the bad-tempered
are made more bad-tempered, and nothing
but bad-tempered, and the good-tempered more good-tempered,
and nothing but good-tempered. And so
on this day, they made our host all over, body and
soul, a host, and nothing but a host. Everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
else, if there had been anything else, was obliterated.
From the bottom of his heart to the tip of his tongue,
and the tip of his fingers, he was a host. If there
was ever at other times a mask on him, it was now
torn off, and what was the essence of his being—the
host—remained unrepressed, unclouded, unqualified.</p>

<p>The guests’ bedchamber contained three beds.
Their scantling was so much beyond what is common
in this part of the world, that one was almost brought
to think that they had been intended to accommodate
each of them two persons. This, however, is an uncertain
inference, for of course they were the work of
a native carpenter, and his ideas may have been enlarged
by finding that in this room his handiwork
would not be so much cramped for space as is usual
hereabouts. Or perhaps the increase in the size of
the beds might have been, and probably was, a result
of this not being Grison ground; for we were now in
Italy, and in Italy beds are generally as remarkable
for amplitude, as in the Grisons for exiguity, of dimensions.
As I had invited Christian to take his
meals with me while we might remain here, I now extended
the invitation to the offer of one of the three
beds. The price I had to pay for this was, that I was
obliged to sleep with the window closed. The good
man had so unfeigned a horror of night air, that is to
say of admitting fresh air from without, into the room
in which he was sleeping, in consequence of some
supposed ill-effects it would have on the eyes, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
there was nothing for it but to comply with his prejudice.</p>

<p>We were now in Italy, and had been since we descended
the Stretta. Our dinner, therefore, on the
banks of the Spöl had been eaten in Italy, and this
had somewhat heightened the flavour of the enjoyment
so many other pleasant adjuncts had contributed
to impart to it. Neither there, however, nor here, nor
elsewhere on the way, had we seen anything of a
custom-house, or of a custom-house official. We
might, to the prejudice of the holders of the bonds of
the Italian tobacco loan, have brought with us to
Livigno, without let or hindrance of any kind, any
amount of cigars that we could have carried. I take
it, therefore, that the dwellers in these valleys on this
part of the frontier, do not burn so many cents when
consuming the fragrant leaf as other Italians, and so
do not contribute much to the payment of the interest
of that loan.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>August 13.</i>—At 6.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> I came down to see
how things were going on. Snow was still falling.
The hillsides down to the valley bottom were white,
but the valley bottom was still green. It was a fête
day, the greatest, I believe, of the year in these
valleys. There was a stream of people passing the
door on their way to the church, about half-a-mile off,
just below the north end of the village. Men and
women were all in their holiday attire. The get-up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
of the men was very like what was common some
years ago, and may still be, in Ireland. Those who
were in the fashion, perhaps who retained the old
fashion, wore the swallow-tailed coat, of a frieze-like
material, but of a dark colour, adorned with brass
buttons, and the knee-breeches with dark gray stockings,
I have already mentioned. Those who were of
a less conservative turn of mind, wore a kind of
shooting coat, and long trousers, but of the same dark
material as the others; probably it was homespun. I
saw no overcoats, which appear to be quite unknown
in this part of the world, where people dress the same
in fine weather and in foul, in summer and in winter.
They give a reason for this practice; they say that
what in this climate they have most to dread is
checked <i>transpiration</i>; and that they dress the same
at all times in order that they may not increase <i>transpiration</i>
by additional clothing, or run the risk of
having it checked by the removal of an overcoat:
that to dress the same at all times is safest in their
climate.</p>

<p>Several of the passers by at this early hour, and
throughout the day, walked up to the table in the
hall, on which stood the black bottles and small
glasses. It would fortify them against the raw wet
day. The shooting jackets which, perhaps, represented
young Livigno and modern ideas, were more open to
conviction on this point, than the swallow-tails. One
brought with him a sturdy little fellow of about eleven
years of age who took his schnapps with the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
gravity and silence as his broad-shouldered parent.
They walked together up to the table, did not ask
for the glasses to be filled, emptied them when filled,
and retired without a word, and without moving a
muscle of the face any more than of the vocal
mechanism.</p>

<p>At 7 o’clock a young man came into the kitchen
to make a mess of polenta. When the milk had been
raised to the full boiling-point, he added about an
equal quantity of meal, perhaps a little more than as
much, and stirred it continuously for about a quarter
of an hour, with a strong crooked stick, to mix it
equally and to prevent its burning. When the meal
had absorbed all the milk, and had become very stiff,
it was prepared. It required much strength to stir it.
He and two companions now sat down at the kitchen
table with the mess before them. One ate it with
cheese; one with milk, and the other with butter.
The old gentleman at the same time descended from
his high stool in the chimney-corner, which he had in
vain attempted to persuade me to occupy, and sat
down at the same table for his breakfast, which his
daughter-in-law had prepared for him. It was a large
basin of soup, or more correctly, of a kind of vegetable
broth. This he ate with black rye-bread. The maker
of the polenta offered me some on a plate. As long
as it is warm it is not a bad kind of food, though far
from as good as the hot maize cakes you get in the
United States, or as the same polenta would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
been if in West Indian fashion it had been allowed to
get cold, and then been cut into slices, and fried, or
toasted. Its merit is that it is quickly prepared, and
requires no apparatus but a pot and stick.</p>

<p>At 8.30 our turn came. Fish again, and everything
we had had at supper last night. The anxious
ministering of the good man was very impressive,
though of course not in quite so high a degree as on
the previous evening. It was too early in the day for
that, though he was already on the road that would
bring him to the same point. At 9.30 he announced
that he must go to church, and that he should be
absent for an hour and a half. I told him that I would
accompany him. A gleam of satisfaction, felt in his
heart, irradiated his face. ‘Well! well!’ was his
reply. He disappeared for a few minutes, and returned
in his festa dress; his face brightened with
soap and with satisfaction. His attire was that of
the innovating party. The function, at which we
were to assist, was to commence at 10. All the world
was on the road, and every face was towards the
church. He conducted me into a detached chapel, a
few yards from the church; it was already full. There
were about sixty men in it—all men. No priest was
present. All were employed in chanting a Latin
Litany to the Holy Virgin. The harshness of their
voices was great, and so was the dissonance, for hardly
any attempt was made to keep together. When the
Litany was concluded, we all left the chapel, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
entered the church. Here mass was to be celebrated.
We, that is to say the men, occupied the right side of
the building; the women, who far outnumbered us,
occupying the left side, and the whole of what might
have been the west end. The service commenced by
seven or eight women walking up the main aisle to
the priest, and, as it appeared, making an offering,
and then returning again down the aisle to their seats.
The large proportion of men in the congregation, and
the demeanour of all indicated that the controversies
of the day had not reached Livigno. Here the sense
of the Unseen, which, under whatever form it may
show itself, is Religion, was quick and strong, and
prepotent in shaping the thought and lives of all. In
them debates about forms had not weakened the effect
of the substance.</p>

<p>As we returned from the church the snow had at
last begun to lie in the valley bottom. The grass
was now buried, and everything on which the eye
rested was white, with the exception of the roofs of
the <i lang="fr">châlets</i>, and the paved roadway, which, however,
was slushy with half-melted snow. The contrast with
the bright sun of yesterday at the same hour was
complete. Twenty-four hours had transported us
from Italy to Lapland. Probably in Lapland the
aspect of things was at the moment more summer-like.
There was no prospect now of doing anything
to-day, for even if it were to clear speedily, it would
be too late to cross the mountains. Dinner, therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
began to assume in one’s thoughts a disproportionate
importance; and we were not long in broaching the
subject to the good man. What could he give us?
We should be glad of the best he had. Had he any
meat? He had. What was it? Was it dried beef?
Well! it was a day for dried beef. That would be
one thing. ‘No,’ he replied with sorrowful firmness.
‘That I cannot let you have.’ Why not? We can
eat it; we have already become acquainted with it,
and you see it has done us no harm. ‘No,’ again, but
with the sorrowfulness and firmness more accentuated.
‘I can let you have eggs, and fat cheese, and
butter, and soup, and fish, but not the dried beef.’</p>

<p>‘My good man, we shall be glad to have it. Why
not let us have it?’</p>

<p>‘Because your souls are due to heaven as well as
my own.’</p>

<p>It was, then, because it was the festa. ‘But,’
quoth the visitor, ‘that is just the reason why we
should have it. To-day is not a fast, but a festa.’</p>

<p>‘No! no! It is impossible.’ Such subtleties were
ensnaring. They came from the enemy of souls. The
fact was that schnapps had quickened the good man’s
religiosity, while they had obscured his understanding.
It would have been unfeeling, and perhaps
unavailing, to have argued the point, or pressed the
request further in any way. And so with thanks for
having reminded us of the road we must both travel
to reach heaven, he was told that his guests would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
content to-day with what elements of meat there
might be in the eggs, and fat cheese, and soup, and
fish, and would dispense with the thing itself in its
ordinary Livigno form of dried beef. Who would not
have abstained from a few shreds of the hock of a
mummied ox for the sake of witnessing the satisfaction
this announcement gave the good man? The
momentary cloud passed away from his face, and he
instantly became again, and, as the afternoon advanced,
in a still higher degree than he had been
yesterday, the man of one thought—the host, and
nothing else. At dinner his ministerings were bliss;
at supper they became devotion.</p>

<p>But dinner, though made the most of, was at last
over; and supper, the next event, was a long way off.
The roadway, and the roofs of the <i lang="fr">châlets</i> had at last
succumbed to the ceaseless snow, and everything was
now unbroken white. The question was, therefore,
forced upon us of What was to be done? How was
the afternoon to be got through? The cold in the
house was getting down to the bone, notwithstanding
the dinner, and frequent visits to the kitchen fire, for
the outer hall door, and all other doors were constantly
kept open for the sake of the light, and the
kitchen fire was a mere pretence, except when some
cooking was going on. The card-players had again
returned, notwithstanding the festa, or perhaps because
of the festa, for ‘on festas the church before midday,
and the tavern after midday’ is a saying here. What,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
then, can be done? Rather for the sake of saying
something than from the hope of hearing any useful
suggestion, I put my despair in the form of a question
to the good man.</p>

<p>‘The best thing you can do,’ he replied with a
readiness and decision which indicated that what he
was announcing was the familiar practice of Livigno,
the outcome of the experience of life in the place,
‘the best thing you can do is to go to bed till supper
time.’</p>

<p>The novelty of the idea precluded an immediate
answer. The time, however, required for fully
taking it in, was also sufficient for enabling one to see
that there was reason in it. Really there was nothing
else that could be done; and so half an hour’s more
looking out at the door, and walking up and down
the hall, overcame the repugnance I had at first felt
to the suggestion. Do at Livigno as the Livignese do
worked in the same direction. And so at 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we
went up stairs, lay down upon our beds, drew our
coverlets over us, and were soon lost, and continued
lost for three hours, to all sense of the incongruity of
a day that would have been wretched in the middle
of January coming upon us suddenly in the middle of
August.</p>

<p><i>August 16.</i>—Last night when we returned to our
beds the snow was still falling: but we took it for
granted that it could not continue into a third day,
and, therefore, ordered breakfast for 4.40 this morning.
True to time were we, and so was the breakfast. Nor
were we disappointed in our anticipation of the
weather. It had arranged itself favourably. Snow
must have ceased to fall for some hours, for it was
beginning to disappear from the valley bottom; nor
was the cloud canopy either low down, or quite
unbroken. With the expectation, then, that the day
would be equal to our wishes, at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we were off.
As to that indispensable part of the ceremony of
taking leave—the bill—on so promising a morning I
was not sorry, perhaps I was rather pleased, that the
good man should find in it a reason for looking back
with satisfaction to our visit, and with hope that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
might be repeated. In respect of his bill the most
attentive of Grison landlords, even one who on fête-days
has his thoughts turned towards Paradise, and is
desirous of helping others to take the right road to it,
is likely to prove only a Grison man, or simply only
a man. Francs here are very precious, and the
opportunities for making them are very limited: we
will, therefore, condone our friend’s inability to withhold
himself from turning his opportunity to the best account.
As we were leaving the house, good nature,
or, perhaps, conscience, prompted him to follow us
into the road with a black bottle and two little glasses
from the table on the left side of the hall. The
morning was cold, and we ought to take something to
fortify us against the cold. We declined on the
ground that we had just breakfasted. Would we then
fill our flasks? We should feel the want of something
strong in crossing the mountain. This offer
Christian in part accepted; and having again shaken
hands, we went straight across the sloppy meadow,
and began the ascent of the eastern mountain.</p>

<p>The first stage up to the forest was almost as
sloppy as the valley bottom. The path through the
forest was better. Above the forest the snow was
dry. At 6 o’clock we had reached Trepalle, a scattered
hamlet with a church. Nobody was stirring.
Immediately beyond Trepalle is a little valley, but as
it is very much higher than that of Livigno, it was
completely buried in snow. So was every mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
side, and top within our range of vision all round. It
was a polar scene. It gave us also a good idea of
what these valleys and mountains must be in winter
to the eye. What strikes one who comes on such a
scene in summer is that the distinctions of colour are
gone: the bright green prairie, the sunburnt houses,
the dark green forest, the foamy silver stream, the
brown green alpine pastures, the gray, or still darker
crags, are now all alike. There is a grandeur in this,
but a diminution of interest. You soon tire of it;
but of the colour-varied scene you never tire. A
little further on we came on a large flock of Bergamesque,
Roman-nosed sheep, attended by a tall,
shaggy-headed shepherd in a sheepskin cloak.
Months it seemed must have passed since he last
washed his face, or combed his hair, or beard. His
flock were bleating piteously, being pinched by the
cold and their empty stomachs, for since the ground
had been buried, which up here must have been at an
early hour yesterday, they could have had nothing to
eat. He seemed to have some difficulty in preventing
them from straying; his object being to keep them
on the side of the hill on which the sun would first
melt the snow. Some way beyond the shepherd and
his flock, as we were nearing the top of the second
range, where the new snow was in places two or three
feet deep, we lost our buried path, and were some
little time before we recovered it: but this was a
matter of no consequence as we could not miss the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
right direction. Just on the top of this ridge we came
on a black lake, with a black shaly margin; all the
blacker because everything else was white.</p>

<p>From this point it was all down hill to the valley
that would take us to Bormio. As soon as we could
command the valley a strange sight opened on our
view. The main valley, its ramifications, and the
spurs of mountains protruded into it, were, at the
distance from which we saw them, and with at the
time no sunshine to light them up, of a dark, almost
black aspect, for green hardly showed at all in their
colouring. This blackness was in the valley bottoms,
and about half-way up the mountain sides. At that
height the snow began; and it began at an uniform
height on all the mountains bounding the valley, and
projecting into it. The snow line was as true, as if
it had been set out by human hand. The upper part
of the mountains, down to about half their height, was
with perfect regularity uniformly white; the lower
half as uniformly black. The division between the
two colours had been made quite fairly, and the line
had been drawn quite truly. We soon reached Foscagno,
from which the Pass takes its name. Foscagno
was just on the line where to-day the snow ceased.
Semogo came next, still on the mountain side. Isolaccia
was the first town in the valley. Then Pedenosso.
After that Torripiano and Premadio. The number
and size of the churches might alone have shown us
that we were in Italy. By the time we had reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
the valley the sun was shining brightly, and down in
the bottom, though it is wide and airy, we felt midsummer
heat. At Premadio we saw just the tip of
the Ortler, peering over the intervening ranges, and
looking like a snow <i lang="fr">châlet</i> perched on the summit of
the highest of them. At 11 o’clock, not having had
any delays or halts, we reached the hotel of the New
Baths of Bormio.</p>

<p>The altitude of the house is 4,580 feet. This, as
it faces to the south, ought to admit of its having a
pretty good summer climate, though I suppose considerable
deductions must be made, particularly in the
first part of the summer, for the contiguity of the vast
snowfields of the Ortler, and for the other snowy eminences
behind it. Its immediate <i>entourage</i> has a
bleak, starved, naked aspect, the ground being poor,
and only partially clothed with vegetation. This
might at first be wearisome, and then repulsive, to
one who was obliged to remain a week or more at the
place, though it is just what gives it its character, and
makes it interesting to the passing pedestrian, who
only sees what can be seen in coming and going, and
whose stay is limited to the time that is requisite
for his dinner within doors, and his cigar on the
terrace outside. He notes only with satisfaction the
poverty of the immediate neighbourhood, the grand
contiguous mountain masses, and the rich colouring
of the long valley below open to the midday sun;
and, before this source of satisfaction has been exhausted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
is on his way to other scenes, full of pleasant
anticipations for himself, seasoned perhaps a little
with the commiseration he feels for those he leaves in
quarantine, at all events at anchor, at Bormio. If
you are to stay at a place, I almost think it preferable
to be low down (of course not quite in the valley
bottom) than to be high up. In the latter case you
have a feeling that you have already seen everything.
At all events you have no desire to go down into the
valley: that is what, as a matter of fact and practice,
no one does. But if your station is low down, you
always feel an impulse on you to climb up some
mountain, or to go somewhere or other to get a view,
or to see something more of the country. We must
except from this remark those cases where the height
and the view are just what one has come for.</p>

<p>At 1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, that is to say after a stay of two hours,
which is about the right time for a midday halt,
which is to include one’s dinner, and which, too,
seemed time enough for Bormio, we began the ascent
to the Stelvio. As soon as you face up towards the
Pass its distinctive character begins to display itself.
The first mile brings you to the old Baths, constructed
on a lofty cliff-niche, like an eagle’s nest, high above
the gloomy gorge of the Adda. As you pass the
waste overflow of the hot spring, you feel that the air
by its side has received some of its warmth. But this
hardly withdraws your attention for a moment from
the gray ravine, and the gray mountain, below steep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
and deep, and above steep and high. Beyond this
the road, still carried high up on the right hand mountain
flank, becomes more impressive. On the left,
beyond the point at which the Adda enters the Pass
from the Val Fraele, the road bends somewhat to the
right, and you enter a still more impressive stage of
the Pass. You are now in the gorge of the Braulio.
The mighty Braulio is on your left, and the south-western
buttresses of the still mightier Monte Cristallo
are on your right. The Braulio has here, and
for some miles on, been cut down in mountain-high
perpendicular precipices of a yellowish-brown, for the
rock is dolomitic. On that side no road could have
been constructed; but so much the better, for it is
very grand as looked at from the road on the opposite
side. On your side, the road side, the mountains
are not mountain walls, but mountain scarps. The
scarps, however, are so steep, and so seamed with
<i>couloirs</i>, that there was the utmost difficulty in making
the road, as there still is, and ever will continue to be
in maintaining it. As you look up the mountain
side from the road, you see, above, masses of detached
rock, as big as barns, temporarily arrested in their
descent, and ready on the slightest provocation to
crash down on the road. Sooner or later they all
must come. At the <i>couloirs</i> is the great danger and the
great difficulty. In them there is no solid foundation
for the road that must be carried across them. Its
foundation, therefore, had to be formed of masonry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
And when it had thus been carried across them, it
was always exposed to be swept away at any time
by a storm, which for the nonce makes the <i>couloir</i> the
channel of a raging torrent of commingled water and
rocks. It, therefore, became necessary first to put the
road in a masonry tunnel, and then to fill the <i>couloir</i>
immediately above it with solid masonry, in order
that the commingled torrent of water and rocks might
not dash upon it, but rush down over it. And, again,
in places where there was not a <i>couloir</i>, but still,
where rocks in bad weather might fall upon the road,
or avalanches in spring, similar precautions became
necessary: in such places the road must be either an
excavated tunnel, or a constructed culvert. These
precautions are indispensable both for the maintenance
of the road, and for the protection of travellers in
bad weather. And however strongly the work may
be done, it has frequently to be renewed, for it is frequently
broken in, or swept away. In several places
we saw men at work repairing the damages of this
kind of last spring. In some places the rocks that
had fallen on the roof of the tunnels and galleries
had done them more or less injury; in others it was
the torrents that had dilapidated the masonry. Everything
here is impressive: the deep gorge with the
angry stream far below the road; the iron-faced
mountain precipices opposite to you; the steep mountain
side above you, which you see is only waiting
for a storm to mobilize it; and which storm, as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
look up at the great rocks caught on the loose <i>débris</i>,
you think can hardly be needed for bringing them
down; because, indeed, for anything you can see,
there is nothing to keep them from falling upon you
while you are observing their massiveness and position.
If you look down into the gorge your flesh creeps; if
you look across it, your mind is solemnized by a
sense of the grandeur of those sheer mountain-high
precipices; if you look up at the rocks ready to fall
upon you, your mind is awed by a sense of the inexorableness
of nature.</p>

<p>Beyond this stage, which had been, pretty generally,
for some miles, more or less on a level along the
mountain flank, the scene changes. You now by a
steep ascent cut off several zigzags, and reach a
higher level, at the further end of which, some three
miles on, is the fourth <i>cantoniera</i>, that of Santa Maria,
where your day’s work will end, and you will take up
your quarters for the night. On this higher level
we again encountered the snow. The day had been
bright, and the snow-plough had not been used here,
and so for the last three <i>kilometres</i> of this distance
we had to walk through sloppy snow slush. In three
hours and a half from the new Baths of Bormio, that
is to say at 4.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, we reached our destination. It
is a large building, for it contains a barrack, a custom-house,
an inn, and lodgings for the people who keep
the road open and in repair. It is well situated in a
sheltered bend of the mountain basin, which lies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
below, and on the south side of, the summit of the
Pass.</p>

<p>We found half-a-dozen Germans in the house:
some of them had come up that morning from the
Munsterthal. A little later, a dozen more arrived
from the Tyrol side, in a light omnibus-like diligence,
and its supplement. Of the whole number only
three slept here: all the rest went down to Bormio.
I was the only Englishman in the house, and in the
visitors’ book the proportion of English names was
small; which, however, implies not so much that few
English parties cross the Pass, as that few stay here
for the night, or have any reason for entering their
names in the book. Scarcely a French name was to
be found in it. The sun was still bright, and as it
was full on the verandah, it was pleasant to sit in
and feel its warmth, while everything around on
which the eye could rest was buried in snow.</p>

<p>I reminded Christian of how varied, and full of
interest, our day had been. In the early morning
Livigno, and the broad snowy ridges of M. della
Neve, where nothing but snow had been seen, then
the long green Val di Dentro with its meadows, cornfields,
towns, and churches, then Bormio, then the
awe-inspiring Braulio, and now a return to the snow
world as complete as what we had crossed in the
early morning. ‘Yes,’ he said, for I knew that I was
talking to a man who had a sense of the elements of
interest in mountain scenery, ‘yes, but we have not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
done wisely. We should have stopped at Bormio for
the night. We might in some way or other have
found this too much, and then the pleasure of the rest
of our walk might have been much diminished.’ I had
myself not been without this thought, and, therefore,
as he had to carry the load, I had at Bormio left it
to him to decide whether we should go on from that
point or not. But being a good and true man, because
he knew what was my wish, and because it was
left to him to decide, he had raised no objection to
going further. Now, however, when the work was
done, and there could be no suspicion of a wish to
shirk, he could say what he really thought. I could
only reply that the imprudence was all my fault:
and that, as it was I who had nothing to carry, I
ought not to have thrown the decision on him.</p>

<p>When those who were to pass the night at Bormio
or elsewhere than at Santa Maria, had cleared out,
and the sun was setting, the buxom and rather
boisterous damsel, who had charge of the guests,
brought in a large basketful of wood, and announced
her intention of giving us a fire, which she forthwith
kindled in a smaller room off the <i lang="fr">salle-à-manger</i>,
where there was an open fire-place. As the wood
was cembra, in five minutes we had a blazing fire,
and together with the three Germans, who were full
of good-nature and talk, we spent a pleasant evening
at an elevation of 8,317 feet in the highest house, the
books say, in Europe, with, though it was the 16th of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
August, a sharp frost outside, which had lost no time
in reasserting its dominion so soon as the sun retired
from the scene.</p>

<p>The buxom boisterous damsel assigned to me for
the night a large room with three beds. One of these
I invited Christian to occupy. He had spent the
evening with us, and as we sat round the blazing
cembra fire had taken part in the conversation, for he
had in youth, as is the custom with so many of his
countrymen, gone abroad, where he had learnt French
and German. This bedroom had double windows,
which appeared to be never opened: and this probably
is the case from fear of letting in the cold. If so the
room can only be aired, or rather dried, on the occasions
when the stove is heated. The bedding, and
everything in the room appeared damp. This I was
told was a result of the snow being continuous
throughout almost all the year, which keeps the roof
and walls permanently chilled through. One cannot
but suppose that dampness, as well as cold, must be
a consequence of such conditions: at all events I
could not but believe that my hempen sheets, three
heavy blankets, and heavy coverlet, owed some of
their weight, I might almost say of their adhesiveness,
to this cause. In the morning, however, we found
that whatever had been the hygrometric state of the
beds, and of the room, in which we had slept, we
were ourselves none the worse. I believe that when
you are taking a great deal of exercise you can resist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
the bad effects of a damp bed far more effectually
than you can when your manner of life is sedentary.
Your system is acting more vigorously, and giving off
a greater amount of animal heat, which enables you
to repel the damp, and saves you from becoming its
victim. In fact, you do yourself air your bed before
it can do you any harm. Be the cause, however,
what it may, we suffered not from cold or damp that
night, while sleeping high above all the other sleepers
of Europe.</p>

<p><i>August 17.</i>—As we were to have an easy day—only
to Trafoi at the foot of Ortler—we were not off
till 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> The sun was not yet on our path, and the
morning was arctic. If there were such things as
summer mornings at the pole, such might a fine one
be there. Everything was hard bound in frost, and
everything was deep buried in snow, except the black
streak along the centre of the road, from which the
snow from Santa Maria to the summit had been
cleared off by the snow-plough. Of course overcoats,
gloves, and scarfs are unknown on these excursions,
so on first emerging from the hotel I felt as if I were
thinly clad, and my ungloved hands were soon
pocketed. But as our way was at first all up hill, and
the air quite still, the chill of the first contact with the
frost was soon lost, which, however, had indeed not
been much more than the chilliness of the interior of
the house in the early morning without a fire. By the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
time we had reached the summit (somewhat under an
hour) we were ready to blunder through the knee-deep
new snow up to a little eminence on the left of the
road, from which there is a commanding view. The
path to it leaves the road just alongside of the road-mender’s
quarters on the summit of the Pass, at the
point of junction of the Austrian and Italian frontiers.
It is ascended in twenty minutes; or if there be
less snow than there was to-day, then in a little less
time. To the north-east, in which direction you can
see furthest, the view is very extensive. To the west it
is grandly intercepted by the contiguous mighty masses
of Umbrail and Braulio. Of these the former is in
Switzerland, the latter in Italy. To the south are the
still mightier masses of Monte Cristallo, and of the
dome-topped Ortler, which send down towards you
two mighty and strangely contrasted glaciers; that
on the right is long and broad, has a gentle descent,
and had on this day a surface that was white and
smooth from the lately fallen snow; its neighbour to
the left, and which is only separated from it by a
narrow rocky ridge, is most unlike it in every one of the
above respects. As seen from our point of observation
it appeared of no great length; it was not spread
out into a large field, but jammed into a narrow
ravine between two mountains. It was not in the
form of a stream, but of a cataract, of ice; its surface,
too, was much rent and fissured; and to complete the
contrast, for some reason which did not appear, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
lately fallen snow had not rested upon it. As to the
general effect of this extensive view, it seemed to me
to be more than half lost by the covering of snow
that had been laid over everything. If form is the
first element of interest in a wide mountain scene,
colour undoubtedly is the second; for colour it is
that gives distinctiveness, and the suggestion of life,
to the forms you are looking at. It not only enables
you to distinguish more readily between the forms,
but also to make out the peculiarities, and interpret
the character of each. Meadows, cornfields, forests,
villages, rocks, Alpine pastures, lakes, glaciers, as well
as the snowfields, are all signalized and understood
by their colour. But when colour is obliterated, and
every object made white, the power of distinguishing
mere form, even that of great masses, is greatly
diminished, while all minor objects become pretty
generally effaced. All nature has then but one aspect.
The scene before us supplied us with a proof of this
value of colour. The only exception to the universal
white were two enormous black holes by the side of
Mount Umbrail. These were points at which we could
look down into the Munsterthal to somewhat below the
line up to which the snow had been melted. As the sun
was not yet touching these depths, they looked almost
completely black by the side of the otherwise universal
white. Of course the eye went back to them
again and again, for they were more suggestive,
and so more interesting, than anything else that could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
be seen. These two, as they appeared, black bottomless
pits were just the two places in the world around
us where the deep valley opened out most, and the
sun had most power. They were, then, the most
favoured spots; and we could translate their blackness
into scenes of industry and village life. If the
snow had been suddenly removed from the whole
scene, with the exception of those summits it, on
account of their height, legitimately occupies, then
they would have been distinguishable from their lesser
brethren. We should have known that they were the
highest tops, however far off in the view they might
have been, and so we should have regarded them
with the respect that was their due. And in like
manner with all the rest of the scene: every object,
having been interpreted by its colour, would have
become interesting. We should have been given to
understand what it was, and should have known what
to think of it. While as things were, the whole scene,
because deprived of colour, was dumb. Nothing
could give us any account of itself except the glaciers.
Vegetation, which is the garb of nature, and which to
so large an extent puts nature into relation to man,
was lost to sight. Another proof of the value of
colour is that, when it has been effaced by snow from
an extensive view, the eye soon wearies of the view,
and to such a degree as to refuse to attend to it any
longer.</p>

<p>The descent was now commenced. As is usual in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
Alpine Passes, there was no resemblance between the
two sides. That by which we had ascended to the
top was long, and had been formed by nature into
several distinct stages, each possessing features and a
character of its own. This presented nothing that at
all corresponded to the upper crateriform stage on the
other side, nor anything at all like the awe-inspiring
V. di Braulio. The descent was very rapid, by an
innumerable series of zigzags, constructed on so steep
a face, that it was a long time, at all events now that
the mountain side was covered with snow, before a
cut-off could be made. The road continued steep,
though the gradient was being eased all the way down
to Trafoi, in reaching which we diminished our altitude
by 4,000 feet. We could not but observe that
the Austrian side was not so well cared for as the
Italian. Here, for instance, the snow-plough had not
been used at all. We had, therefore, as the sun was
now well up, to walk through some miles of sloppy
snow. On this side, too, there were no refuges.
Probably, however, this omission arose from the fact
that the whole of the first two or three miles is equally
exposed to snow avalanches; there was, therefore, no
more reason for protecting one part than another, and
it would have cost too much to have protected the
whole. We saw to-day evidence of this general
exposure, for even the late midsummer fall of snow
had yielded some half dozen avalanches; some small,
but others of sufficient mass to have blocked the road;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
these, therefore, it had been necessary to remove, in
order to make a way for the traffic: they would, probably,
have upset a carriage had they fallen upon it.</p>

<p>The contour of a mountain results from the nature
of the rock of which it is formed. Here it is of talcose
slate. This is readily broken up by frost. The consequence
is that in the course of ages enough of the
mountain has been disintegrated to form an incline
from top to bottom, just at the angle at which it is
possible for such rubble to rest. Such mountains
will, therefore, be without precipices; their <i>pente</i>,
however, will be very considerable. It was in the
steep rubbly incline of this mountain that the zigzags
had to be made. It will be also seen that in such a
formation there can be no flat spaces, or protruding
rocks. On such a face, therefore, snow will, as a
general rule, begin to slide before it has accumulated
to any great amount. There being nothing from the
first to hold it up, as soon as it begins to gather
weight, down it must come. Here therefore the avalanches
will be very frequent, but not very serious.</p>

<p>When we were about half way down to Trafoi the
snow ceased, as I have so frequently had on this
excursion to observe of summer snow, at just about
the line where the forest commenced. We were now
descending along the north-western roots of the group
of the Ortler, of which, and of its glaciers, we had
frequent glimpses. As we approached Trafoi, we
had a magnificent view down the Trafoier valley, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
consequence of a bend in the road having opened the
distance to us: a world of far-off summits, some
topped with white, were in a moment brought into
the field of the eye. One stood pre-eminent above all
the rest. I was told that its name was Weisstobel.
It was of purest white, in form resembling the black
mountain superimposed on a mountain I had
noticed at Livigno. It was as symmetrically shaped
as if it had been the long, lofty nave of a cathedral,
with a slanting roof, but without towers or pinnacles.
It must be the king of the mountains of that district.</p>

<p>We reached Trafoi at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> An Austrian
custom-house officer was standing at the door of the
inn. We asked him if it was there that he would
inspect the little we had with us. He seemed to
take it rather amiss, almost to be disposed to be
offended, that we should have imagined him capable
of so mean an action, one that might seem to
imply some distrust. We found that he was staying
at the inn, and was, as might be inferred from his
forbearance, a goodnatured, convivial variety of the
species.</p>

<p>Again what a contrast! Three hours ago I had
been standing on the little rocky eminence above the
Pass. Everything was buried deep in snow, and
bound hard in frost. In the level rays of the early
sun, the hard frozen particles on the surface of the
deep snow around us gleamed like so much diamond
dust. Around to the distant horizon the landscape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
was only arctic. Now the climate had been changed
as well as the scene, for I was seated on the spacious
verandah of the Trafoi inn, with the scattered village,
its little church, and garden plots around me, not
dazzled, nor scorched, but only so quickened by the
flood of light and warmth the sun was pouring down
on the spot, as to feel that they were life to myself, as
I saw that they were to all organized nature around
me.</p>

<p>The view from this verandah is food, and, too, very
pleasant food, for the eye. The point of central
attraction is the Ortler, with its smooth, massive,
dome-shaped cap of snow. It seems quite close to
you. To the right of it, standing well to the front of
the snow-field, and very near to you, is the mighty
black pyramid of the Madatsch. On this day it was
profusely reticulated with veins of the new snow that
had lodged in its crannies. The Ortler and the back
of the Madatsch are, as viewed from this point,
apparently joined together, on the furthest horizon,
high up against the sky, by a long mountain wall of
purest white. Between them, projecting toward you
from this distant horizon of the snow wall, is Trafoier
Spitze, a ridge of black, or of white, precipices, as each
happens to be of naked rock, or to be faced with snow.
On each side of this ridge of the Trafoier Spitze is a
great glacier, one descending from the Ortler, the
other from the Madatsch. The lower part of the
Madatsch is cut diagonally by an ascending ridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
which is clothed with a thick forest of dark green pine.
All this is on your right, as you sit on the verandah
with your back to the house, and just at the best
distance for taking in all the features of the scene, the
dark forest that rises athwart the lower part of the
Madatsch being quite close to you. In front of you,
beginning at the Ortler, beyond the green meadows
and the Trafoier Bach, which are below you, is a
range of slaty coloured mountains, so near that you
can make out every object upon them, the detached
rocks, the cattle, and the decaying trunks of fallen
pines. The first of this range runs athwart the roots
of the Ortler, its gray summit being overtopped by
the Ortler’s snowy dome. This range is steep, barren
at its summit, and shagged with cliffs, some gray, and
some stained black with lichens. Its flanks are seamed
with slaty coloured <i>couloirs</i>, between which are
breadths of Alpine pasture above, and below the more
or less scattered pines of an open forest, in contrast
with the close forest that rises against the black
Madatsch. Then on your left, as you look down the
Trafoier valley are many distant summits of the
Tyrol: supreme among these is the snowy cathedral
nave, gleaming in the bright midday sun.</p>

<p>This view was my most distant point; and it
seemed a worthy conclusion of my outward course.
It was a grand and varied scene: mountains black,
and mountains gray, and mountains white; snowfields
and glaciers, cliffs and <i>couloirs</i>; forests of closely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
set, and forests of scattered, pines; emerald meadows
in the valley, and sombre pastures on the heights.
Within hearing the appropriate music of the Trafoier
Bach. Above all the luminous field of unfathomable
blue, sparingly chequered with a few streaks and flecks
of white cloud, just as on the earth beneath the intermingled
shade varied the bright sunlight that was
being shed over the forests, and the mountain sides,
and the cliffs of the ridges. Close by, somewhat to
the left, was a small cluster of humble shingled <i lang="fr">châlets</i>,
the village of Trafoi, to suggest the hopes and fears,
the joys and sorrows of the peasant’s life; just in front,
was the last and chief structure of the little village,
the little church with its humble shingled spire, to
suggest the villager’s anticipations of a life beyond
the present scene. At 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> clouds began to form on
the highest summits. First, the distant snow-wall,
that seemed to connect the further side of the Ortler
and of the Madatsch, became lost to sight; then the
Ortler and the Madatsch themselves put on their
cloud-woven <i lang="fr">bonnets de nuit</i>. The bottom line of this
cloud-mass was now ruled straight. It just reached
down to the glaciers. All above and beyond them
was utterly lost to sight. The level, gray cloud-mass
was to the eye a solid stratum, which originated the
glaciers, and out of which they streamed down into
our valley.</p>

<p>In the evening we walked through the meadows
and pine woods, and across the Trafoier Bach, to the
foot of the glaciers.</p>

<p><i>August 18.</i>—Down at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>; but as the people
of the house are not yet accustomed to such hours,
did not get away till six. A good deal of linen that
was in the washerwoman’s hands had been left out
during the night on the roadside rails in front of the
inn. Here it is taken for granted that every peasant,
and that every one, too, who passes along the road,
and it is one of the most frequented roads of the
country, is an honest man. Of course they are
honest, because almost every one has property, or expects
to have it, and has been brought up among
those who have it. The instincts, therefore, which
property engenders have become universal. These
instincts, where the properties are small, are industry,
frugality, forethought, and honesty. Some years ago,
while travelling in the East, I had collected for my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
friends at home a bundle of walking-sticks, made
from the mid-rib of the palm leaf, the olive wood of
Jerusalem, and the balsam of the Jordan. Wherever
I had gone I had left the bundle about unheeded,
knowing that no one would meddle with it. Where
a woman may go unmolested through lonely ways,
with several gold coins conspicuously displayed on
her head, there cannot be much disposition to pilfer.
It was dark, when on my return to England, I landed
at Southampton. My luggage had to be taken by
the dock servants from the quay of the dock to the
custom-house, only a few yards. In those first few
yards on English soil, half-a-dozen of the best sticks
were stolen. In the custom-house I called the attention
of the dock people to this inferiority in our
English civilization; and with some emphasis dwelt
on the words stolen and thief. I was informed that
my language was actionable; and that it would be
taken down in writing, if only I would be so good as
to repeat it. This I had no objection to do, if only
the writer would head his notes with the <i>dicta</i>, that
the man who endeavours to screen a thief is as bad as
the thief; and that if the property stolen has been
entrusted to the safe keeping of the thief, and he, and
those whose servant he is, are paid for protecting it, the
theft is of an aggravated kind. Of course no more was
said about taking down in writing my estimate of the
occurrence. The sight this morning of the linen which
had been left out all night by the roadside brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
that little matter back to my recollection, and led me to
infer that there must be some condition in the arrangements
of society at Trafoi, as there had been in the
East, which worked effectively in favour of honesty,
while there must have been something at Southampton
that worked in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The walk down the Stelvio below Trafoi was not
altogether lacking in distinctiveness of feature, as
must be the case with every mountain-bounded valley,
and indeed with every object in nature. What most
arrests attention here is some little peculiarity in the
manner in which the mountain summits have been
weathered away, and the decay of the rock brought
down to form the lower slopes now occupied by
forests, and by the bottom lands which man has reclaimed
for grass. About Trafoi, and for some way
below it, you are able to look into the forests on the
flank of the mountain on the opposite side of the
stream. You see there that many decaying trunks of
pines strew the ground. They were thrown down by
storms, or fell through age, and no one thought it
worth his while to remove them, and bring them across
the stream. The people, then, are few, and the pines
are plentiful. This led us to discuss the question,
whether it was on the cards that Trafoi should become
another Pontresina. I was disposed to hold
that it would. We can see no reason why the stream
of tourists that has now reached Pontresina should
not flow further. Trafoi comes next. What brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
it to Pontresina is present here to bring it on to
Trafoi. Here is a great snowfield, and a grand view
of it: mighty summits, more or less difficult of access
and ascent; and a better climate, for it admits of the
growth of potatoes, and even of cabbages; and the
Tyrol is open to you by the Vintschgau in much the
same way as the eastern Grisons are from Pontresina
by the Engadin. Its turn then, I think, will come,
unless some better point of view can be found in the
circumference of the Ortler group, and which shall
be at the same time easily accessible. Indeed, even
now all that is wanted is the construction of a carriage
road over the Stretta and Foscagno Passes to save
the long round by Tirano on the south, or by Martinsbruck
on the north. I am, therefore, disposed to think
that the purchase of land at Trafoi would prove a
good investment. I saw that the line for a road over
the Foscagno was already staked out. The special
advantages of Pontresina are the sense of space about
it, which you have not here at Trafoi, and that it is
not only accessible itself but that also much is accessible
from it. Should the stream, however, reach
Trafoi, we may be sure that charges will not remain
at the moderate level at which I found them, both
there and at Santa Maria.</p>

<p>At last our valley of Trafoi, which had been
trending north, debouched into the valley of the
Adige, the direction of which at this point is from
west to east. Had we descended it on the right, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
would have brought us to Meran and Botzen. But as
I now had to begin to set my face homewards we
took the road to the left up the valley. Our destination
was Tauffers. The day was very warm, and there
was little air; we now, therefore, began to regret the
hour that had been lost at starting. Between the
point at which we left the Stelvio road and Glurns
are two villages. We stopped at the inn of the first
of the two for a glass of Austrian beer. I do not
know whether the Austrian excise, plus the cost of
carriage, would justify the price asked, or whether the
lady of the house was demoralized by the unwonted
apparition of an Englishman, it being supposed popularly,
that every Englishman has a gold mine in his
pocket; she did, however, demand, and received, one
franc and forty cents for two glasses, each of which
contained not much more than half a pint. Glurns,
which is walled and fortified in the old style, is the
chief town hereabouts. A little beyond it you come
to a scene which has a curious effect. You are turning
round the foot of the mountain on your left; but
if you will look up the valley of the Adige beyond
Glurns, you will see a perfectly smooth, broad grass
expanse, descending gradually towards you. It may
be somewhat less than a mile wide, and two miles or
more long. It is impossible for you to see it without
thinking of a glacier; indeed it is very like the one
we saw yesterday, flowing down from Monte Cristallo
towards the summit of the Stelvio. If it were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
buried in snow you would probably take it for a
glacier. Of course the site of this grand breadth of
prairie was in old time formed by glacier action: but
it is strange that the glacier should have formed it so
precisely after its own image. Another peculiarity of
this prairie is that it is totally unbacked by either
near or distant mountains. All along its further side
the sky line is the grass line. I never saw this before
in Alpine scenery. Everywhere else whether you
look up, or down, an expanse of grass land, mountains
close the view, and supply the sky line.</p>

<p>Some two miles from Tauffers we passed through
a short-turfed cow-pasture, with thinly scattered small
larch, and thickly scattered small fragments of rock.
It was several hundred acres in extent. Its whole
surface was blue with the flower spikes of a small
species of Veronica. Christian, who is somewhat observant
of plants, was unacquainted with it. This
shows that the climate is here very different from
what it is in the neighbourhood of Pontresina, of
course in the direction of being warmer and drier.
This field of blue supported an observation I had
previously made that I know of no country—we were
now again close to the Swiss frontier—in which there
are so many flowers as in Switzerland of this colour,
both as regards the number of species and of individuals.
The preponderance of blue is certainly not
the rule on the limestone hills that stand round about
Jerusalem, and which are remarkable in spring for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
abundance of flowers, nor is it in any other mountain
region with which I am acquainted.</p>

<p>Our road was now again on the ascent; the sun
was hot; the air was still; and perhaps the Austrian
beer aggravated the effects of the ascent and of the
heat. Tauffers, contrary to what we had expected,
was not yet in sight; and so our then state of body
and mind suggested to us the thought that the Teufel
had taken away Tauffers. At last, however, it came
in sight, and this expression of our discomfort was no
longer tenable. Still the ascent continued, and the
heat became more aggravating; and though we
plodded on we got no nearer to it. It was clear now
that Tauffers was the Teufel. Even the sight of its
three churches did not dissipate this supposition; for
we were disposed to be cynical, and so they only reminded
us of the saying, of course the result of the
experience of mankind, that ‘the nearer the church
the farther from heaven.’ The village, therefore, which
has the greatest number must be the farthest off of
all. Our suppositions and cynicism were not abandoned
when we had entered Tauffers, and on applying
at the White Cross, which the Austrian Preventive
official at Trafoi had strongly recommended to us,
had found that their only bedroom was engaged for
the night. These are small jests, but they were at
the time enough to laugh at, and lightened the way.</p>

<p>There was, however, another inn in the place, the
Lamb, and that, fortunately, was both a better house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
and had all its accommodation at our disposal. We
were shown upstairs to the reception-room. It was
evident that it had not been used for some days, for
the table and benches were covered with a thick
stratum of long undisturbed dust. This, as the
windows were closed, and are seldom opened, their
purpose being to admit light, and not also air, must
have required a long time for its deposition. The
woman of the house, with an infant in her arms, and
radiant with good-nature, and the desire to do all she
could for her guests, swept off the dust with her apron.
The first question was of course the old standing question
of all wayfarers. What could be had for dinner?
We did not care whether it was <i>bifteck</i>, or <i lang="fr">côtelettes de
mouton</i>. The radiancy was extinguished. It was as
if a rosy dawn had been suddenly overcast by dark
clouds. These viands were unknown in Tauffers.
Having failed in this <i>reconnaissance</i>, we fell back on
what we deemed must always be in this part of the
world a secure position: she could, then, let us have
some dried beef. In Tauffers that also was unknown.
Things began to look serious. There was nothing to
fall back upon; and so we must now take our chance,
from which, however, we could not see exactly what
was to be expected. We, therefore, gave the good
woman a <i>carte blanche</i>: let us have whatever could be
had for keeping body and soul together in Tauffers.
This seemed to reassure her. She began to enumerate
the best resources, the luxuries, of the place. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
might have macaroni soup. Very well! We might
have a salad with eggs. Excellent! A pause.
Could we have bread and butter? We might have
the bread but not the butter. There was no butter in
Tauffers. None? None: but she would send off a
despatch to the alpe, and perhaps might get us some
for supper. At all events she could let us have some
cheese? She could: but it would be only meagre
cheese. There was no fat cheese in the place. Well,
then, let us have for dinner the macaroni soup, the
salad and eggs, the bread and the meagre cheese;
and let us have all these viands as soon as possible.
Yes, yes. We should have them all in half an
hour.</p>

<p>More than an hour having passed, and there being no
symptoms even that the table would ever be prepared
for receiving the dinner, we again summoned the good
woman to ask the cause of the delay. Had she to
wait till the macaroni was made, or till her hens had
laid the eggs? No! no! She had lost the key of
the linen chest, and had been an hour looking for it:
but now she would break the lock. This we peremptorily
forbade. To-morrow it would be all the same
to us that we had dined to-day, as we had dined often
before, and might often again in the future, without a
table-cloth and napkins. But the loss of the lock
would to the good woman be an abiding loss: for
such places have no locksmiths; and the franc, or so,
a new lock would cost, is in Tauffers something considerable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Like the good man of Livigno, she regarded
our reasoning as sophistical. It was the voice
of the Tempter, endeavouring to persuade her to do
what her conscience told her was wrong. The
sacrifice must be made. And so it was: for a few
minutes afterwards she re-entered the room with the
indispensable linen, and began to lay the cloth,
smoothing it down with a touch and air that implied that
she knew its value, and how much it had just cost her.</p>

<p>The dinner soon followed. First the soup. After
one has been out for six and a half hours in a hot sun,
and has withal begun to feel a little fagged, any warm
liquid, that can be swallowed without offence to the
palate, seems comfortable. Fatigue makes one shrink
from anything cold, from an instinct of the system that
it would rather not make the effort to bring the cold
draught up to the temperature of the body. We
were, therefore, not rigid critics of the gastronomic
merits, or demerits, of this macaroni soup. It was
enough that it was comforting; as it certainly was to
the good woman to find that we had so far approved
of it, as to have emptied the basin. Like the soup at
Peist, it would probably on analysis have yielded no
evidence that meat of any kind had in any way
entered into its composition. Of what, then, had it
been made? I believe of the same ingredients; that
is to say, it was a broth of herbs, enriched with spices,
among which mace predominated, and thickened with
vermicelli and flat macaroni. And now the <i lang="fr">pièce de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
résistance</i>, the salad, was placed on the table, supported
with twelve hard-boiled eggs. The lettuce
was crisp and good, and the oil with which it was
profusely dressed, was not rancid. I managed to
dispose of three of the eggs. I could go no further.
Christian placed himself outside the remaining nine.
For this, though he had been encouraged to complete
the achievement, he thought some apologies necessary.
Guides, he remarked deprecatingly, always had good
appetites. Apologies, I told him, were quite unnecessary,
for his dinner had to sustain the porter as well
as the guide. And this justification of his appetite I
made him understand was not invented for the occasion,
but was the result of the long and hard experience
of a poor woman, who having had to provide
daily bread for eight small children, had explained to
me that, though there were only eight mouths to feed,
yet in fact, as each child had two natures, his growing
nature, and his natural nature, she had to feed daily
sixteen natures. This put Christian quite at his ease.
It did even more, for it made him feel how superior
his bachelor condition was to that of the poor sixteen-natures-weighted
woman. As to the meagre cheese,
it tasted like nothing in particular: not even much
like cheese. The bread was white, and not yet
sufficiently old to have become a petrifaction.</p>

<p>So ended our dinner to the satisfaction of all concerned;
perhaps to that of the good woman most of
all, who, seeing how her soup, and salad, and eggs had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
been dealt with, could not refrain from an announcement
of her hope of being able to get the butter by
supper time. As soon as we had taken possession of
the room, I had opened the window. I now leaned
out of it to see what from this point could be seen
of Tauffers. Our inn was on what might be called
the <i>place</i> of Tauffers. Opposite to it was the public
fountain; and beyond that a large house. It was
now four in the afternoon. The village is far from
small, and must contain about 500 inhabitants.
Several ploughs, drawn by cows, or bullocks, of a
diminutive breed, were returning from their daily
tasks. For the human toilers, however, the day’s
work was far from done, for a continued succession of
little carts, full of manure, each containing at most
what might have been put into four or five wheelbarrows,
was going out to the fields. Every now and
then a woman would pass with an enormous bundle
of hay in a hempen sheet on her head, or shoulders.
The woman of the large house opposite was in the
road, cutting the trunks of some long cembras with a
cross-cut saw into klafter lengths (six feet), aided by
a sturdy little boy as her mate. When the cutting
was completed, the pieces were carried by the two,
and piled up against the outer wall of the house,
facing the street. This is done universally, for though
the fuel is thus left in the street, there are no dishonest
people to pilfer it. This woman’s house was a large
one, and would require here an establishment of two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
or three servants, and an income of 300<i>l.</i> or 400<i>l.</i> a
year. But I was told that the family that occupied it
had no servants; indeed, that there was not a
domestic servant in the place; that every family in
Tauffers did its own work; and that the family in the
big house had not 60<i>l.</i> a year to spend.</p>

<p>Behind the big house, and just above the town,
for as things go in these parts it is more than a village,
is a strange-looking mountain. It is of an equally
sharp incline from top to bottom, smooth on the
surface, without rocks or trees, and only half clothed
with a very threadbare vegetation; this half clothing
being as even as the underlying soil which shows
through it. The vegetation, then, being poor, and the
soil pale, the general colouring is not grass green, but
a kind of celadine. In the evening I went some way
up it to see of what its soil and vegetation consisted.
The soil was of a much disintegrated gritty kind of
rock; but as the disintegration hardly proceeded
beyond the point of grit, no turf could be formed
upon it, for the rainwater that did not run down its
steep incline, ran through it, as through a sieve. And
that, of course, that ran down over such a surface
would take with it any mould that there might have
been an incipient attempt to accumulate. This
decided the character of the vegetation. No plant
could maintain itself on such a station, unless it had
good roots for holding on, was able also to do with
very little moisture, and to live all the while on a diet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
as simple and meagre as that which was supporting
the inhabitants of the neighbouring town. The
species were mostly veronicas, pinks, sedums, and
saxifrages. The majority of them, therefore, were
such as are on a close inspection conspicuous for their
flowers. Almost the only grass was an agrostis which
affects poor and dry stations. These plants were
nowhere continuous. Each seemed to require, or had
at all events received from the grace of circumstances,
some elbowroom. The vegetation, then, of the mountain
belonged to the class of things that improve on a
near acquaintance, for when you were upon it you
found that it was decked with a great variety of very
bright, though humble, flowers. I was sorry to see
that an attempt had been made to plant a part of the
mountain with cembras. The little plants had been
set each in a little hole, and were only a few inches
high. One can hardly believe that in a century they
will be many more feet. But should they ever rise
above the ground, which as yet they show no disposition
to do, their presence will destroy the singular
character of the mountain.</p>

<p>The first stage of the ascent brings you to a
church: I suppose the pilgrimage church of Tauffers,
for it is very common in this part of the world to find
a church on an eminence, at a little distance off, to
climb up to which, and attend its services on certain
days, and at certain seasons, or for certain classes, or
for certain objects, is a meritorious act, which will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
secure some special favour from some local saint, or
some saint that respects the locality, or whom the
locality respects. On reaching this church, I found
that it stood on a little excavated and levelled platform,
a kind of niche, on the shoulder of the mountain.
On this little stage the water could hang longer than
on the declivity, and there was besides the water that
came off the roof of the building. This had encouraged
the grass immediately around it, and up to its
walls, to grow vigorously. While walking round it, to
get a view of a ruined castle beyond it, I came suddenly
on a little girl upon her knees, intently employed
in chopping the long grass with a sickle-shaped knife,
and depositing the handfuls in an old cloth. Not
another soul was in sight, or within hailing. She appeared
to be about 9 years of age. It was evening.
The sun was low, and the valley was in shade; but,
here was this little body, not playing with her fellows
at the end of the day, not looking out for her father’s
return from his labours, but labouring hard herself, far
from home, and all alone. The evening, which brings
rest to all, and the mother to her child, had not
brought rest to this little premature grass-cutter, and
had separated her from her mother. As I came down
the mountain, half an hour later, when the remains
of light were fast retiring before the brown shades of
approaching night, I overtook on the path the little
body, with her burden, as big as herself, on her head.
This bundle of coarse grass was to be made into hay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
and added to the store of winter provender for the
goats and cows of the family.</p>

<p>Such is the training of life for all in Tauffers.
Nature intended it to be hard, but not so hard as the
crimes and follies of man have made it. Half of this
little body’s evening task, and half of the daily and
yearly toil of every man, woman, and child in Tauffers
is lost to them. They have to task themselves with
the toil; and then half the fruits of the toil is snatched
from the hands of the toilers, and sent to Vienna to
support 1,000,000 men in arms, for which a second
tax in flesh and blood is levied on poor Tauffers, and
to pay the bondholders of a debt incurred through the
profitless, and futile attempts of Austria to maintain
a hateful dominion in Italy, and a shadowy and impossible
hegemony in northern Germany.</p>

<p>On the mountain above the church you get a good
view of this broad interesting valley—up and down.
You see how much land there is available for cultivation,
and how carefully it is cultivated, and what a
large population it is supporting. Several villages
are in sight, and you will be able to count a hundred
houses in Tauffers, which lies at your feet. The view
is more diversified than one coming from the Grisons
will have lately seen. It has much land in corn as
well as in grass. The expanse is sufficiently broad
to give you the idea of its being a substantial component
part of the scene, and not merely a little strip
reclaimed from the foot of the mountains. It is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
itself something considerable, and in the general
effects of the view can hold its own against them.
The mountains, too, right and left, and before you,
are grand; the latter ending against the sky in the
snowy summits about the Stelvio. At this point also
you are not far from the three old ruined castles of
Tauffers. As I looked at them, I thought that if we
could recover the details of their day, we should find
that the civilized exactions of a modern empire are
not greater—perhaps they may be more all-pervading,
though we will not be positive even on that point—than
were the rude exactions of mediæval local oppressors.
The old Baron, like the modern Kaiser,
appealed to the sense of glory, but whoever it might
have been that was glorified, it was no more then,
than it is now, the poor peasant. And there was
then, as now, a claim for personal loyalty, in return
for protection; but then, as now, it was a protection
that was very costly to those who were supposed to
be protected. So wags the world. One unsatisfactory
condition is exchanged for another that does
not give satisfaction. But, throughout, men are
dreaming of, and hoping and striving for, something
better. And dreams, and hopes, and efforts have
hitherto been the salt of life.</p>

<p>As I re-entered the village I passed a <i lang="fr">châlet</i> surrounded
by grass. On the grass, in front of the
house, were spread out to bleach three pieces of
coarse hempen linen, the winter labours of, I suppose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
three families. They were of varying lengths. I
paced them, as I passed, and found that the longest
measured about fifty yards. The differences in length
indicated, perhaps, not so much differences in industry,
for here all are industrious to the best of their ability,
as differences in the opportunities for this kind of
work, and in the number of hands, in the families to
which the pieces respectively belonged. Considering
how slowly the shuttle advances in the hand-loom, I
wondered that any human being could have the
patience to weave these fifty yards of linen, and hoped
that the time would come when the rewards of labour
would in these valleys be such as to enable these poor
women to withdraw from this old-world monotonous
form of labour; and when among them, as among all
people claiming to be civilized, all the coarser kinds
of labour, which task not the intelligence, but only
the hands and muscles, of men, and still more if of
women, will be delegated to iron and steam.</p>

<p>And now we had returned to the hotel; for, as it
was getting late, Christian had gone out to the mountain
to fetch me in for supper. The good woman set
before us the coffee, the milk, the cheese, the bread,
and last of all another platter, with ‘Behold the
butter!’ She was duly thanked; and afterwards
assured that the world could show none better, and
that the merits of the coffee and of the milk were
equally indisputable. While we were at supper three
German pedestrians came in. They were on their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
way to Bormio by the Umbrail Pass. They took the
other end of the long table, and in time their supper
was served. They had no coffee, but instead of it,
the same kind of soup we had had at dinner. The
salad and eggs were not reproduced. Our dinner,
possibly, had caused a dearth of the latter. Instead
of the white wheaten bread, with which we had been
served, they had black rye-bread.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>August 19.</i>—Left Tauffers at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Our destination
for the day was Tarasp in the Engadin; the
way was up the Val Avigna over the Cruschetta, the
Pass of the Scarljöchl, and then by the Scarlthal.
The morning was bright and frosty with the air from
the north. After ascending for two hours, all the
way through forest, to my surprise we came on an
irrigated meadow of about four acres. It could belong
only to Tauffers, for there had been no gaps in
the mountains all the way up. So far then, had these
industrious people gone, and up so rough a way, to
level and irrigate this little bit of land. Every stone
had been cleared from it. It was as smooth as a lawn.
The channel, too, for bringing the water to it, though
not long, had not been easy to construct. I imagined
them toiling up to their work, and then bringing down
the hay along the rocky pathway they had made for
this purpose, and for bringing down timber; and then
in imagination I saw the Austrian tax-collector seize
upon, and carry off, half the produce of their labour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
It would have been a cruel misfortune, if, after they
had had all the trouble of making their meadow and
road, an earthquake had swallowed up, or a slip
from the mountain had buried, just half of their
meadow. But in that case the first loss would have
been all. There would have been no more labour expended
on the swallowed up, or buried half. That
would have been bad; but what the government does
is worse. It obliges them, year after year, to keep
up, to irrigate, and to make the hay upon, this half,
and to bring it down to Tauffers; and then it takes
it all away from them. And this is to go on for
ever.</p>

<p>We had now got beyond the forest, and, therefore,
looked back for the Ortler: and there was its perfectly-shaped
dome, rising above the mountains that
form the eastern boundary of the Munsterthal, not to
any great height above them, but still a conspicuous
and noble object—a symmetrical dome of purest
snow. Of course the higher up we advanced, the
loftier to us the dome would become. Forty minutes
further on, just below the last rise to the summit of
the Pass, we came upon another surprise in the form
of a second prairie. We were now nearly three
hours from Tauffers, and as the forest had ended with
the first prairie, the road had been continued up to
this point exclusively for the sake of the second: this
last part of it, however, had not been difficult to make
for it was over Alpine pasture, and only required the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
removal of rocks and stones in the lines the rullies
would take in going to and fro. The moral of the
sight was that when people work upon their own land
and in that sense for themselves, they work with a
will, which will take no denial, and which will not even
be discouraged by the claims of a government to go
shares with them in the fruit of their labours. This
prairie was larger than the one lower down. Like
that it had been carefully levelled and irrigated;
though, of course, as the elevation was much greater,
the hay was not so good: it was, in fact, not so grassy,
being largely compounded of non-gramineous plants.
From the same cause its growth was shorter, and it
came later to maturity. This was August 19, and
the last load was, as we passed by, being laid on the
little rully on which it was to be taken down to
Tauffers. The man who was loading it, was working
alone. He was a spare weather-beaten veteran.</p>

<p>Beyond this last upland prairie was the summer
<i lang="fr">châlet</i> for the alpe around, on the mountain flanks.
At the back of the <i lang="fr">châlet</i> was the natural rock staircase
up to and over the Pass. When we got near the
top the path lay over a stream of clean loose rock,
with unfilled interstices, and beneath these, quite out
of sight but well within hearing, was rushing along
the stream of water, collected from the heights right
and left. On the summit we stood for some minutes
feeding our eyes with a farewell look at the noble
Ortler. Its snowy dome now stood high above the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
black ridge of the Munsterthal mountains, which, as
a base, with the two long ranges of the Val Avigna
for its equal side-lines, formed at this point a long
acute-angled triangle. At its apex on the Cruschetta
we were standing.</p>

<p>The way was now down hill for four hours to
Tarasp: at first over high Alpine pastures. Here
we passed the ashes of a fire that had been kept up
last night to scare away from the cattle a bear, which
was supposed to be in the neighbourhood. After a
time the pastures thinned out, and the path entered
on a narrow gorge between precipitous fawn-coloured
mountains. It then passed over a reach of pebbly
<i>débris</i>, which the stream of the Clemgia had in times
of flood washed clean. It was a scene of much desolation.
‘You see,’ said Christian, ‘how much more
destructive in this country water is than fire can be.
Fire may be arrested; and at the worst destroys only
what can be replaced. But water cannot be arrested,
and it destroys not only moveables and houses, but
also the precious land itself, the source of all our
wealth.’ As we passed through this scene of its destructive
action, walking over the rocks, and rocky
rubble it had brought down, and across the deep seams
it had cut in these deposits, I felt that if one must
be caught in a bad storm, there would be few places
that would not be preferable for the encounter to such
a gorge as this, where one would have about as much
chance of escaping as a minnow has from the throat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
of a pike. As the gorge became still narrower the
path was now obliged to leave the level of the torrent,
and mount some way up the flank of the right hand
mountain. This soon brought us into the forest; and,
as the sun was bright, the air was incensed with the
fragrant exhalations of the Scotch fir, which hereabouts
was abundant. We were now about four miles
from Tarasp. In front of us to the north-west, beyond
the Engadin, many snowy summits were in sight.
On the topmost point of each the sun had raised into
the otherwise unbroken blue a cloud-banner. These
cloud-banners were of very different forms, each appearing
to retain its own form persistently. One was
a cap of liberty; another a wide-spread oak; another
an inverted pyramid attached to its mountain-top by
its apex. At last after about four miles of the forest,
its trees having now become larch, we got down to the
level of the Engadin. Schuls was on the opposite
bank; but instead of crossing the Inn to Schuls, we
turned to the left, and having crossed the Clemgia,
not far from its junction with the Inn, took up our
quarters at, I believe, the Belvidere, the most southern
of the numerous hotels of Vulpera, a hamlet of hotels,
about half a mile from the Curhaus of Tarasp, which
is an enormous establishment on the left bank of the
Inn. It was 12.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and we had been out seven
and half hours without a halt.</p>

<p>As we had now got back to the Engadin Christian
Grass’s engagement had terminated. He was to receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
15 francs a day, returning being paid for at the
same rate as service. This is the regular market
price at Pontresina for long engagements. It would
not be so high were there more guides, or fewer
tourists. You may sometimes hear those who have
paid lower prices elsewhere speak of Pontresina guides
as extortionate. This is a mistake. The higher and
the lower prices are alike the market prices: only here
the market is in favour of the guide, while in such a
population as that of Meiringen it is in favour of the
tourist. I was sorry to part with Christian, but my
plans would not for the next three or four days require
a porter; and as the wind was now northerly, and
the weather seemed to have arranged itself for a period
of ‘settled fine,’ he appeared to wish to get back to
Pontresina for the chance of some twenty-five franc
days on the glaciers. After dinner, then, having entrusted
my belongings to the Post, which would now
for a few days be my porter, I accompanied him, for
he would forthwith commence his return home, as far
as Tarasp. As I returned up hill to my hotel at
Vulpera, a feeling came over me as though I had undergone
a sudden transformation from a well enough
contented tourist into a lone wanderer far from home.
For the moment neither the thought of home, nor of
wandering far from home, pleased. Life seemed a
pilgrimage without an object. Of what use could it
be to see the world? What pleasure was there in
being where I was? Nor could I say to myself that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
I wished to be anywhere else. ‘Vanity of vanities, all
is vanity and vexation of spirit.’ Such was the effect
this evening of suddenly finding one’s self alone.</p>

<p>As I re-entered the hotel, some two hours later, its
sixty German inmates were sitting down to a solid
supper. At one o’clock I had seen them acquitting
themselves like Germans in quelling the sacred rage
of appetite: but now at six o’clock it had to be
quelled again. No wonder that they were disposed
to give the Tarasp waters a trial. The only thing to
wonder at would have been that they had been made
any the better by drinking them. I stood quite alone
in being content, instead of the solid supper, with ‘a
complete coffee.’ Probably some of the sixty thought
me too far gone, or too poor a creature, for the waters
to benefit.</p>

<p>Of course the Engadin is everywhere good. Here
at Vulpera the mountains are bold and varied. One
of the nearest—it is the one just before you as you
stand at the door of the Belvidere—has a grand
summit of massive jagged rock. Equal merit cannot
be predicated of its climate at all times, or at any
time for long together. In its three months of cold,
the annual supplement to its nine months of winter,
the south wind brings rain and snow, and the north
wind brings frosty mornings, and disagreeably chilly
evenings. So had it been this morning; and so was
it now this evening: there was no sitting, or loitering
about out of doors.</p>

<p><i>August 20.</i>—My plan for to-day was to walk over
the Fluela Pass from Süs in the Engadin to Davos
Dörfli, a little place at the head of the Davosthal, just
below the summit of the ridge, which in nature
separates the Davosthal from, though by road it connects
it with, the Prätigäu. I had to turn out at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>,
that I might have time to get breakfast, and to walk
to Tarasp for the 5.10 diligence from Schuls, which
was to take me to Süs. Süs I reached at 7.40.
Several villages, some of them almost little towns,
were passed by the way. The combinations of mountains,
woods, villages, reclaimed land, a good road often
constructed in difficult places, and all the time by your
side a full stream, worthy of being one of the main
head waters of the Danube, were enough to maintain
the interest of a drive of two hours and a half.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>Now that, having left Süs, I was on the road
absolutely alone—for that could not have been said
of my position yesterday evening with sixty Teutons
under the same roof, to dine and sup with at the same
table—and alone, too, for the whole day, but, however,
with something to see and to do, I was no longer disposed
to feel like a lone wanderer far from home. The
world seemed a home, and a glorious home, full of
objects in every direction that had plenty to say, and
were very good company. For the first two hours
the valley is narrow, not quite of the ravine kind, but
still generally with very little grass, and sometimes
with none at all. When at this distance from Süs
you are just getting clear of the forest, the dreariness
and desolateness of the scene begin to be felt. You are
high above the brawling stream; you see its foamy line,
but cannot make out its movement, nor hear its brawling.
Summits scarred with dark cliffs are right and left
of you. Before you, and, if you look back, behind you
also, are summits capped with snow. The snowy
summits before you are those of Piz Vadred, from
which you see descending the great Grialetsch glacier.
Between that and you is a singularly dead looking
grayish valley. You think that there is no indication
of man’s presence here, except the road on which you
are walking. A few steps, however, further on bring
into sight a <i lang="fr">châlet</i> in the bottom. The singularly
dead-looking grayish valley does, then, maintain for
two or three months in the year a herd of cows. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
had been thinking that its produce could not go much
beyond lichens and mosses. You go a little further,
and come upon another <i lang="fr">châlet</i>, that of the alpe of the
next higher level, which carries you up to the summit
of the Pass. But the cows and herdsmen are this day
out of sight. You see nothing moving. Rocks and
snow alone attract your attention. You pass a forbidding
looking stream; dark, chilly, gruff. It is
snarling at you, and telling you to be gone. As you
get to the further end of the long lozenge-shaped
amphitheatre, which conducts you to the summit of
the Pass, with the Fluela Weisshorn on your right,
and the Schwarzhorn on your left, the snow-patches
begin to cross the road. On the actual summit the
road is on a level, with a small lake on either hand.
The raised viaduct separates, and their respective
colours distinguish, the two. That on your left being
fed by water coming direct from the near glaciers is a
lake of milk. That on your right is so crystal-clear
that you might take it for mountain air liquefied.</p>

<p>Just beyond these two contrasted lakes was a small
hotel. I felt, however, no inclination to exchange the
glorious day and scene outside for the interior of a
small room; and so with a salute to the landlord, who
was standing at his door to offer me the hospitality of
his house—under such circumstances the salute
seemed almost a kind of mockery—I continued my
way on. The scene, as is usual on reaching the top
of a Pass, was now totally different from what I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
lately been noting. The immediate <i>entourage</i> was of
a darker rock, and the mountain tops were green and
rounded. The road for the first mile, or so, seemed
to be along the arc of the segment of a circle. In a
spirit of speculation I took to the scattered rocks
along the chord of the segment. Among the rocks
were many pools of water of marvellous transparency.
Every stain and scratch on the rocks at the bottom of
the water was as distinct as if there had been no water
at all, indeed they might have been more distinct, for
as seen under the water they had the appearance of
having been brought out by varnish. This water, too,
was so pure and fresh for drinking, that a draught of
it made me think that I had never drank water before,
and could not hope ever to drink it again. As I regained
the road I was overtaken by the diligence,
which I had left at Süs, preparing to start, three hours
previously.</p>

<p>One welcomes the return of the first trees. It is
good to be in the zone above the trees. It is
good also to find yourself returning to the zone of
trees. The first you come upon tell you they have a
hard time of it. You interpret their stunted form and
irregular growth, and their crooked, broken branches
as so many accusations brought against the cold long
winters, and the cruel storms, and the summer frosts,
whose assaults they have had to sustain. They are
maimed, and scarred veterans who from their youth
up have lived in the midst of war’s alarms and injuries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
but who will not yet be driven from the field. Their
reappearance, too, reminds you that, in respect of the
effects of the landscape, they stand in the same relation
to the grassy turf that the mountains do to the
plains. They feed the eye of man, and furnish his mind
with ideas and images. Without them vegetation
would have no more interest than the earth’s surface
would have without the mountains. Each, too, has
its place in the working arrangements of the general
scheme; the mountains in those of the world-organism,
and the trees in those of organized life.</p>

<p>With these thoughts I passed the little inn of
Tschuggen, five miles below the summit. About a
mile and a quarter below Tschuggen, and a little
above the inn of the Alpen Rose, I called my midday
halt. I took my position among some clean slabs
and fragments of a slaty-coloured glistening rock, a
few paces above the road, and on the right side of it.
I was here sheltered by a wood of larch from the north
wind, which was cold at midday. As I looked towards
Tschuggen, up the way I had been descending, a
snow-topped pyramid, perhaps the Schwarzhorn,
bounded the view. Then looking across, instead of
up, the road, the mountain of the opposite side rose
near and steeply. It was a big mountain, but not of
the naked rocky order, for its flank, full in view before
me, was pretty well covered with a vestment of vegetation.
In this, the predominant element was a sedum
now profusely in flower, which made yellow the predominant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
colour of the vestment. Just below me, on
the other side of the road, and somewhat below the
road, was a <i lang="fr">châlet</i>, surrounded by little grass patches,
wherever the land could be levelled, from the road
down to the valley bottom, out of which rose, immediately
beyond the little stream of the valley, the
yellow-vested mountain. The family, that lived in the
<i lang="fr">châlet</i>, were alertly at work spreading, or carrying,
their little parcels of hay. Old and young, all appeared
to be together in the field. As I watched the
labours of this busily employed family I thought their
position not unlike that of the first trees I had just
seen some miles above. Like them, and from the
same causes, they had to sustain the struggle for life
against great difficulties. In the contemplation, however,
of their industry there was something to suggest
the thought that their hard days were not rendered
additionally hard by the discontent and the vice,
which are seen and felt wherever life is maintained on
easier conditions.</p>

<p>From this halt an hour and a half of pleasant
walking brought me to Davos Dörfli, a well situated
village in a broad expanse of grass land at the foot
of the Davoser see. It is only a mile and a half from
Davos am Platz, at which I had dined on my descent
from the Strela seventeen days back. My way then
lay to the south. I had since made a round I was
disposed to think worth the time. To-morrow I was
to set my face north for the Prätigäu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>When you are walking, and the more so if you are
alone, you are disposed to note the changing aspects
of the weather. Here, then, are the observations that
were made on this day. At 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> at Tarasp there
was an unbroken canopy of cloud: but it was not low
down the mountain sides. At 6 the summits that
were lofty enough for snow were standing clear; but
the lesser summits were still shrouded with clouds.
At 8 most of these had disappeared. From 9 till 12
only thin streaks and flecks of cloud high above all
the summits. The definition of every mountain ridge
and pinnacle against the deep blue was now very
remarkable. At 12 clouds began to form on the tops
of the mountains, and spreading widely to a considerable
extent obscured the blue. At 4 these formed
solid masses, and the sky was much more obscured.
At 6 the clouds sunk low down on the mountain
sides, so as to shut out the view. The wind was
northerly all day. In the early morning it had been
so cold from Tarasp to Süs as to make the <i>banquette</i>
of the diligence not altogether pleasant. Near Süs I
saw potato-patches by the road side that had been
blackened at the extremities of the haulm by frost.
Throughout the day, even when for some hours I was
walking up hill with the sun on the road, the air was
fresh and crisp. I have already mentioned that on
the previous evening at Tarasp it had been disagreeably
cold. This evening at Davos Dörfli I again
saw potato haulm that had been injured by frost.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
Not, then, taking this day as a sample of the climate,
for its merits were too much above the average for
that, but taking it as a sample of a fine day, almost
the best kind of day the climate has to show, we may
say that in summer on some days, for some hours, the
climate is pleasant. The mornings and evenings,
when the weather is fine, that is to say when the wind
is from the north, are too cold. In the fine hours of
the fine days the sense of enjoyment from a sense of
penetrating freshness, and of penetrating warmth, is
very delightful.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>August 21.</i>—Had been assured last night that
coffee would be ready at 5 this morning. This
promise was a case of deception prepense, for there
had been no intention of letting me have it till half
an hour later, when eight or ten Germans, who were
to leave at 6, would have their breakfast served. On
these occasions it is of no manner of use to complain,
or to give yourself the trouble of showing in any way
your dissatisfaction; or rather it is better not to allow
yourself to feel any dissatisfaction at all. The master
of the hotel is master of the situation. And in a place
like Davos Dörfli, where there is only one moderately
good hotel, the rule of its master is a despotism, untempered
by any effectual competition. Here again,
as at Tarasp, I found the hotel full of Germans, and
of German-speaking Swiss; and, as a consequence,
the table well supplied, and the charges moderate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
At both of these places I had been reminded of three
portions of cold meat I had ordered at Pontresina.
To give the particulars—they consisted of six circular
pieces, each of them of the diameter of a florin, and
no thicker than a well-worn three-penny. For this
the charge was about equal to the weight of the pieces
in francs. Such doings would be impossible at Tarasp,
or at the Dörfli of Davos, or at the Platz of that ilk.</p>

<p>At 5.45, then, I got under weigh. My road for
the Prätigäu lay at first along the level shore of the
Davoser see for about a mile, and then for about a
mile or so more up a gentle rise of some hundred or
two feet in all to the Davoser Kulm, which from this
side seems rather to connect than to separate the two
valleys. Though, indeed, you afterwards find that
the one you are bound for is a considerable way down
on the opposite side. About a mile below the summit
I descended into a cloud, and walked in it for about
five miles, that is down to Klosters. I heard a stream
at times, but did not see it; and the books say that I
passed a lake, but I know no more of it than what is
said in the books. All that I saw was the road, and
the mist-shrouded trees by the roadside, from which
abundant drops were falling. Not a breath was
stirring, and it was very chilly. The altitudes were
from 5,300 feet on the Kulm to 4,000 at Klosters. I
might as well have been on a November morning in
the Essex marshes, or in the Lincolnshire fens. Just
above Klosters, without any intimation of the coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
change, I stepped out of the cloud. There before me,
a little below, were the four villages that form the
commune. Many of their houses were goodly structures
of stone. Around the villages was a large
expanse of good land. This first glimpse of the
Prätigäu was worthy of its reputation of being one of
the best cultivated valleys in Switzerland, which,
arising out of, and taken in connexion with, their
system of land tenure, is what accounts for its large
population of 10,000 souls. It was for the sake of the
contrasts its high cultivation and its populousness
would offer to what I had seen in the valleys I had
lately been wandering through, that I was here to-day.
The altitude and climate of most of them restricted
the industry of the inhabitants to the cultivation of
grass; and this in its turn was a great restriction on
the number of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>From the first to the second village the road reascended
a little. This brought me again almost to
the level of the cloud, and here the position of the
road placed a long reach of the valley before me.
The effect was strange, and such as I do not recollect
ever to have seen elsewhere. The stratum of cloud
just roofed the valley. To the eye it was a flat roof,
both on the upper, and on the lower, sides. As I
looked forward the eye traversed the valley, below
the roof, just as it might a long gallery. The cloud-roof
was at an uniform level, resting on the mountains
right and left, but of course the valley below it fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
away as it advanced in its descent. I cannot say
how many miles I saw down the valley under this
roof. Though from my point of view it appeared
perfectly continuous, and without holes or fissures,
such could not have been the case, as was evident
from there being several patches of sunlight in the
valley. These patches of sunlight were poured in
through fissures or holes in the cloud-roof, that is to
say through skylights in it, and they not only gave a
strange and unwonted effect of light and shade in the
valley—the unlighted, which was the greater part,
showing of a dark gloomy green, and the lighted
patches of a bright golden green—but also enabled
one to see under the roof to a great distance.</p>

<p>On turning round to look back in the direction by
which I had reached Klosters, I saw another curious
effect of cloud. The valley all about Klosters was
clear and bright. Somewhat above this visible, sun-lit,
lower expanse began the masses of cloud I had
passed through in descending. As I was just below
these clouds, and looking up at them through the
opening over the neighbourhood of Klosters, in the
area of which opening I was standing, they hid from
me the whole mighty mass of Piz Buin—it is 10,700
feet high—except just the snowy summit. None of
the supports of the summit were seen or suggested.
While I looked at it, it disappeared and reappeared,
again and again, as the vast stratum of cloud moved
on, or rose, or sunk a little. Of course the head of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
Piz Buin was very far above my stratum of cloud, but
as I was close to it, and looking up at it, it was
enough to intercept all but the summit, which every
now and then it did intercept. As the snowy summit
appeared and disappeared, it seemed as if it was not
the cloud but the summit that was moving; for was
it not at one moment peering down into the valley,
and the next moment withdrawing itself? The effect
was most unnatural. The unsubstantial fleeting cloud
became the solid and fixed, and the top of the mountain
which stands fast for ever the floating, object.</p>

<p>A further acquaintance with the Prätigäu confirmed
the first impression. I have nowhere seen a
richer green, or more of it, or a more pleasing, I
might almost say a more wonderful, combination of
woodland, grass, corn, and fruit trees, or more
numerous villages, or so many scattered <i lang="fr">châlets</i>. Of
course there is not much of this kind in the grassy
elevated valleys I had lately been traversing; indeed,
I had seen nothing of the kind since I had left Coire
on the third of the month; and what you see here is
far in advance of what you can see in the neighbourhood
of Coire, with the exception of the vineyards.
The bottom of the valley is well cultivated. As you
ascend to a higher zone the fruit trees are gradually
replaced by forest trees, and the garden ground by
grass, the <i lang="fr">châlets</i>, however, still continuing. When
the amount of population is recalled all this can be
imagined almost without its being seen. The amount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
of cultivable land, almost all of it made land, is of
course the first condition. The next is the altitude of
the valley which ranges from about 2,000 feet at
Grüsch to about 4,000 at Klosters; and then its
direction, which is such as to give it protection from
the northerly winds, and to expose one side to the
midday sun, while its length is raked both by the
morning and evening sun. These physical conditions,
however, would not count for much were they not
accompanied by certain human conditions. Every
man of these 10,000 souls, in proportion to his ability,
turns to the best possible account every square foot
of his land, and every ray of sunshine that falls upon
it, because he and his family will get the whole benefit
of his thought and labour. They clear the ground,
and dig it deep, and enrich it all they can, because it
is their own ground. They plant, and they tend what
they plant carefully, because they, and not others,
will get the fruit of what they plant and tend. Herein
lies the motive of their industry.</p>

<p>Neither, however, this motive, nor the <i>terrain</i>
nature and the course of events have placed at their
disposal, would be of any avail were it not for the
presence of another condition, which has been entirely
overlooked by those who advocate in the press, and
on the platform, the system of peasant proprietorship.
This other condition is knowledge—the knowledge of
all that is required for supporting a family throughout
the whole of the twelve months, the knowledge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
how all these things are to be produced from two or
three acres of land, and the knowledge of how each
article is to be kept in store, and when used to be
used most advantageously. These are the particulars
of what is very far from being a simple problem. It
is, in fact, the most complicated form in which the
problem of how life is to be sustained is submitted to
any portion of the human family. In comparison
with it the form in which the same problem is submitted
to our agricultural labourer is simplicity itself.
He has nothing to do but to take from his employer’s
hand on Saturday evening the regulation wages of
the neighbourhood, and to transfer them to the
hand of the village shopkeeper for all that he will
want during the next seven days. Add to this that
the law has established for his behoof a national
benefit society, which will provide for him in sickness,
and in old age, and which will not forsake him even
when he has shuffled off this mortal coil, for it will
supply the coffin in which he will be carried to his
grave;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and then we shall be able not quite to see, but
to get a glimpse of, how completely his life is a school
for the non-attainment of this knowledge. In precisely
the same fashion, and to precisely the same
result, domestic service will have acted on the mind
of his wife. They have both been thoroughly and
most efficiently trained not to have the knowledge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
and the habits of mind, a peasant proprietor must
have, if he is to live as a peasant proprietor. I think
it may be safely asserted that out of our agricultural
labourers not one in 10,000 has this knowledge, and
that not one out of 1,000 is, as things now are with
that class, of the mental stuff which would enable
him to attain to this knowledge; for it is a kind of
knowledge which is the result of the accumulated experience
and training of many generations. It is not the
knowledge of how to live as a market-gardener, or as
a small farmer: they live by selling and buying: but
the knowledge of how to produce from a little bit of
land what will directly, and without the intervention
of much buying and selling, support a family. The
main support of the family is to be the produce of
their own labour applied to their own land. This is
a most special kind of knowledge. It involves a
multiplicity of calculations and considerations. It is
as special as, and far more complicated than, that
required for enabling an Esquimaux family to live
within the arctic circle. To be carried out successfully
it requires the hearty single-minded devotion to
the work in hand of every day of the life of every
member of the family, that work varying much from
day to day. If an acre or two, or two or three acres,
of land were given to an English agricultural labourer,
it would never occur to him to turn it to this account.
He would only think of making it a petty farm, or a
market-garden. This is what, whenever he chances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
to get hold of a bit of land, he invariably does. He
has not the kind of knowledge which is requisite for
enabling him to entertain the idea of peasant proprietorship,
that is of maintaining his family by the
direct produce of the two or three acres. That would
require an amount of forethought, forbearance, hard
work, helpfulness, and above all of varied knowledge,
of which he is quite incapable of so much as forming
any adequate conception.</p>

</div>

<p>Now turn your attention for a few moments to the
Prätigäu peasant proprietor. He has no wages to
receive. Wages in this connexion mean in one word
all that is requisite for supporting life. They include
everything. Nothing is omitted from them. He has
to find all these requisites by another road, and in
another fashion. He has no village shop to procure
for him, and to keep in store for him, all the articles
that he will want. Pretty nearly everything that he
and his family will require for the twelve months he
has to procure from his small plot of land. This will
require all the ingenuity, forethought, and industry a
man is capable of. Consider what it implies. He
will have to produce every article himself, to keep it
in store himself, and to make it go as far as contrivance
and frugality can. His house, too, is his
own, and he has to take the same care of it as of
everything else. There is no one but himself to repair
it. The same remark applies to his fuel, every stick
of which represents so much of his own labour, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
his clothes, which represent so much of the labour of
the family. The wife, too, must be as great an adept
in this kind of knowledge as the husband. They were
both brought up in its traditions, and were trained to
it from their earliest years. Every day of their lives
they have under the pressure of a quite inexorable
necessity been perfecting themselves in its practice.
All their neighbours are employed in the same way.
There is nothing going on among them that diverts
attention to anything else.</p>

<p>If these Prätigäu peasants were transferred to this
country, they could do in England what they do in
the Prätigäu. If 10,000 of our peasantry were transferred
to the Prätigäu, and put in possession of the
existing houses, and of the land, and of every appliance
needed for cultivating it, the only result would
be universal starvation. Simply because they would
not have the knowledge, and habits of mind, requisite
for enabling each family to live from its little plot of
land. The land would be the same; the motives for
turning it to account would be the same; but the
moral and intellectual conditions would be wanting.
These conditions, then, must not be omitted in
answering the question of what it is that has made
this valley a garden that is maintaining its 10,000
gardeners.</p>

<p>In old times it may have been held by some half
dozen mailed lords. The ruins of the castles of
several of these old oppressors may still be seen in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
the valley. Of one we are told that the peasants took
it with clubs and stakes; the wall with which the
lord of another barred the lower ravine is still standing.
One object of this wall was that it might enable
him to levy imposts on the necessaries of life, in order
that his own life might be more affluent at the cost of
the poor. Such a state of things may have its
picturesque side; but who would not very much prefer
to see the valley as it is, the garden of 10,000 gardeners?
Or in these days we can imagine its becoming
a Chamois preserve. But again, I suppose most
people would prefer to see it remain as it is, the
garden of 10,000 gardeners. We know of nothing
better in this world than men and women; and when
the men and women are intelligent, industrious,
honest, and can, under very difficult conditions, steer
their course clear of the rocks and quicksands of
pauperism, then, although they may be deficient in
the refinements which culture may confer on those
who have wealth and leisure, still they are in many
valuable and attractive qualities far above large
classes that we in this country wot of. But be this as
it may, the average human heart is more pleasingly
touched by the picture of their hard and humble
labours than by that of the mailed Baron and his
dependents, or of the Chamois preserver, and his
Chamois. Probably they have as brave hearts as the
Baron and his dependents had: at all events their
fathers drove them off with sticks and stones, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
even the women of Schiersch in 1622 showed such
heroism in assisting their husbands to repel their
Austrian invaders, that the men of Schiersch have
since that day conceded to the women of Schiersch
the honour of receiving the sacrament first. And,
too, probably they are as much disposed to respect
humanity, and to help those that need, and to do to
others as they would that others should do to them,
as the imaginary Chamois preserver would be.</p>

<p>A little above Kublis on the pebbly borders of a
torrent, down the flank of a mountain, where it was
impossible to retain soil enough for cultivation of any
kind, for the occasional rushes of storm water would
sweep from the surface anything soluble or tender, I
found the coarse shingle dotted with hazel, and briar
roses, and barberry, and much of this open thicket
almost smothered with the wild clematis then in
flower. This vegetation again reminded me of how
completely I had this morning changed the climate.
Where I had been of late nothing of this could have
been seen. A few hours ago, in leaving Davos Dörfli,
I had passed frost-blackened potato haulm; and for
three weeks I had not had much to look upon, in the
way of vegetation, besides pine woods and grass.
What I now saw prepared me for the advent on the
scene of the broad glazed leaf and feathery arrow of
the maize.</p>

<p>A mile or so below Kublis the green valley is
suddenly contracted into a rock-bound and wooded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
ravine, which has in the bottom no more space than
is sufficient for the blustering Lanquart and the road.
Whatever good land is hereabouts must be high above
you on the top of the ravine. This ravine ends at
Frederis Au, a kind of watering-place, some little way
off from the road. Here you again come on good
bottom land, some of it under maize. A little further
on, the stream is again compressed between high
rocky banks.</p>

<p>At Schiersch, having now done twenty-five miles,
I stopped for dinner. It is a place of some size, and
has many goodly stone houses; but what attracts you
most is the story of the still-honoured heroism of its
women. The books told me that the Lion was the
chief hotel of the place. Accordingly I entered the
Lion, and was shown up to the first floor. It was
evident that the room into which I was shown, like
the sword of Achilles which could either hack a baron
of beef, or carve a Trojan, was used for two purposes.
The long table and benches on one side of it showed
that it was intended for travellers’ accommodation.
The sofa, however, and chairs, a little work-table on
the other side, together with the presence of Madame
herself and four children, one asleep on the sofa, one
suffering from whooping-cough, the third waiting on
the invalid, and the fourth in the mother’s arms,
indicated that it was also the Lady’s sitting-room, and
the nursery. The guests who came and went while
I was in the house were waited upon by the husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
only. My successive inquiries for mutton, beef,
butter, eggs, fruit, cognac, extracted from him only
negative replies. What, then, did the good people of
Schiersch live upon? He could let me have cheese
and dried beef. I had been expecting mutton
<i>côtelettes</i>, with a dessert of figs and peaches. In my
disappointment I felt disposed to go on further. I
could hardly fare worse by doing so. But after I had
entered the house I felt a disinclination, by leaving it,
to balk the expectations of the good people, and
perhaps my own too. And so I spent half an hour
at the Lion. As to the dried beef, I had ceased to
think it actively bad. The wine was rather sour.
Against the cheese nothing could be said.</p>

<p>Together with the above viands there was presented
to me this problem. If this is all that Schiersch
can set before its guests, what is the usual fare of the
Schierschers themselves? Few of us as we pass
through a smiling Swiss valley think, or know, how
hard its inhabitants live. They, poor souls, or rather
their hard-worked bodies, have neither the dried beef,
nor the half sour wine, nor yet such cheese as I had.
Meagre cheese, the curd that rises, on the second
heating, after the first curd for the cheese has been
removed, black rye-bread, polenta, and potatoes
constitute, with coffee for their chief beverage, the
normal fare of the inhabitants of most of these valleys.
The greater part of the butter, and of the fresh meat
that they produce is sent off to places, where there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
hotels with many travellers to be provided for. All
the fat of the land of the Prätigäu is in this way forwarded
to Davos am Platz, Ragatz, and Coire. Having
disposed of this question not quite satisfactorily, for I
had rather that its settlement had been more in favour
of the good people of Schiersch—the brave women of
Schiersch at all events deserve something better;
and having, too, disposed of the comestibles which
had suggested it, I said my adieux to the members of
the family of the Lion, and proceeded on my way,
caring little, and not knowing much more, where I
was going, except that there was a place two miles
further on called Grüsch.</p>

<p>The first mile was through low wet meadows.
Beyond these the torrent of the Lanquart had in
times of flood, carried away all the soil, leaving behind
nothing but rubbly stones. These covered a wide
expanse, rather more than a mile in length. The
peasants of the locality, like a community of bees, or
ants, whose nest, or hive, has been disturbed, had
taken in hand the repair of the whole of this damage.
They had carried a dozen, or more, dikes across the
valley, and crossed these again at right angles by
another series of dikes. This had divided the whole
of the desolated space into a considerable number of
square compartments. Their plan was to fill these in
succession with the muddy water of the Lanquart,
hoping that the deposit from this, would in time bury
the stones, and give them a surface of alluvium,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
capable of supporting grass. Some of the compartments
were already supporting beds of reeds. If,
therefore, the dikes should not be washed away by
some unusually heavy flood, the time must come when
soil enough will be accumulated for grass. May
this precious grass one day crown and reward their
labours!</p>

<p>At Grüsch I was well repaid for having preferred
the ills I knew not of to those of which I had had experience
at Schiersch. I found it in many respects
an interesting little place. First it is well situated.
There are points of view in the village, from which
the mountains seem to stand round about it grandly,
quite to come down into it. On the north side a bold
ravine has been rent from some height up in the
mountain just down to the level of the road. Some
of the houses are old and large, and were once the
residences of local grandees, of the days when
Grüsch had grandees. In one of these I found my
supper and bed—a supper of veal cutlets, coffee,
butter, cheese, and raspberry <i>compote</i>. I give the
particulars not only from a sense of what is due to
Grüsch, but also for the sake of encouraging Schiersch
to greater efforts. As to my berth for the night; I
was at first shown up a stone staircase to a spacious
room containing three beds. From its ornamented
panelling and ceiling it must originally have been
intended for a sitting-room. I was more than satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
with it. When, however, there was no further prospect
of the arrival of a family, or party, of distinction, I
was informed that there was a better bedroom in the
house, that it was at my disposal, and that the few
things I had brought with me had been removed to it.
Even after this announcement I was quite unprepared
for its magnificence. It was a kind of state apartment.
It was gorgeously papered. It had muslin
window-curtains. The stove cased with white china,
and bound with hoops of polished brass, had an
imposing effect. The pillows and coverlet were edged
with cotton lace. All this was overpowering, coming
so close on Schiersch. And, then, the manageress
was so good-natured and obliging, so anxious to know
what might be wanted, and seemed to have so much
pleasure in doing it—almost as much as the good man
at Livigno had had, whose regard for his guests had
extended even beyond this world. But the crowning
grace has still to come. After breakfast to-morrow
morning, I shall have to pay for this substantial fare,
the splendour of my bedroom, and so much pleasing
attention, only 3 francs, 30 cents: the same sum,
except the 30 cents, I had paid at Schiersch for the
refection of dried beef and sour wine. This will
compare, too, very favourably with the bill at Livigno.
That had been 30 francs, 60 cents. But then our
friend at Livigno had catered for both worlds, for soul
as well as for body. At parting I could not but shake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
hands with the young woman who had waited on me
and her satisfaction at finding that her attentions and
ministerings had been appreciated was alone quite
worth the 3 francs, 30 cents. All this was a great deal
to get for so little in this hard world.</p>

<p><i>August 22.</i>—Was off at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Just below Grüsch
the road passed by a scene of recent devastation, very
similar to what I had seen yesterday evening just
above the town. A late flood of the Lanquart had
swept over some three or four acres of garden ground,
from which it had washed out every particle of soil,
leaving behind only a bed of clean pebbles. Some
corners and shreds of potato and corn patches alone
remained to show the passer-by what the poor
peasants had lost. One saw proofs of the efforts they
had made to save not only their crops, but that which
was of far more value than the crops of a single
season—the precious land, their only means of living.
In the hope of turning the flood back again into its
channel they had constructed a kind of long <i lang="fr">chevaux-de-frise</i>,
first by fastening pieces of timber together at
right angles to each other, each piece being about ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
feet long, and then lashing several of these cross-tied
bars, at intervals of about three feet, to a long pine
trunk. These contrivances they had fixed at points
they wished to protect. Faggots had then been laid
athwart the three-feet interstices, in order that the
pebbles and rubbish the flood would bring down
might be piled against them. Of course these fortifications
had not been set at right angles to the line
of the flood, but slightly inclined down it, so that
when it impinged upon them, the line of least resistance
to the impinging flood would be in the direction
that would take it back to the main channel. I suppose
the plan had been to some extent successful, for
the land behind the second line had been mostly
saved. I was reminded of Christian Grass’s remark
on a similar scene in the Scarlthal, that for these poor
people to see a torrent sweeping away their land is a
far more dreadful spectacle than to see the flames
devouring their houses.</p>

<p>Just beyond this scene of devastation was the
stock of pine trunks, that had last winter been cut in,
and brought down from, the forest above by the men
of Grüsch, for their supply, during the coming winter,
of fuel and of timber for house repairs. The size of
the trunks is, if age be taken into account, an indication
of the nature of the soil and of the climate.
These gave good evidence in favour of the soil and
climate of the Prätigäu. I measured the butt end of
the largest of them. It was nearly four feet in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
diameter without the bark. This must have been a
stately tree. I counted, too, the rings of its annual
growth. It had been one of the patriarchs of the
forest, for one hundred and forty had been the number
of its years. Four generations of Grüschers had withheld
their hands from converting it into fuel or money,
and a fifth generation were now to have the benefit of
their educated forbearance.</p>

<p>The exit from the Prätigäu is through a grand
portal. The precipices are high and sheer; the
Lanquart is rapid, dashing, and dinning; the road is
tortuous. At the last turn of the road, where the
precipices are highest and sheerest, and the Lanquart
most rapid, dashing, and dinning, you suddenly step
out on the long and broad expanse, here two miles
wide, of the Rhine valley. The spirit of the scene is
changed. Some of this broad flat is so poor, all
vegetable mould having ages ago been washed out of
it, that it will grow only stunted trees, and some so
low and wet that it will grow only reeds and rushes.
Should you be making for Ragatz, as I was, two roads
will be before you; one along the foot of the right-hand
mountain range by Malans and Maienfeld, the
other straight across the valley and the Rhine, which
is here on its further side, and then along the foot of
the left-hand range. For a moment I looked on the
scene before me, and then went straight on. The two
miles of dead level would be something new, and
would give me some idea of what the Rhine valley is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
here. The two next miles beyond the bridge over
the Rhine, and on to Ragatz, with the morning sun
full on the road, and against the side of the overhanging
mountain, were memorably warm.</p>

<p>Ragatz commences on this side with a monster
hotel. Between a large orchard, which you reach
first, and this hotel is a road which brings you in
three or four hundred yards to the road from the
town to the gorge of Pfäffers, at the very mouth of
which Ragatz stands on the beginning of the level
ground. It was still early, and so, without stopping
at Ragatz, I went straight up the gorge. From
Ragatz to the old baths is a distance of two and a
half miles, and an ascent of somewhat more than five
hundred feet. The road is good, though it must have
been very costly to construct, and must be so to
maintain. The side on which it is excavated and
built is not so precipitous as the other, which is generally
sheer cliff from five to eight hundred feet high.
All the way along, the Tamina is rushing by and
tumbling down before you. You see that it is wearing
away its rocky bed; and you can see no evidence,
nor imagine any reason, why you should not suppose
that it was the same stream that in the same manner
cut out the whole of the ravine. If sufficient time be
given, it is as easy to cut out eight hundred feet as
eight. The perpendicular face of the cliff which looks
to the east does not at all stand in the way of this
conclusion. Of course the rapidly descending water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
was disposed to take a straight line, and even, if
diverted from the straight line, to work back to it as
soon as possible. And then it would naturally cut
down its channel perpendicularly, because, as it would
be flowing rapidly, it would keep its cutting tools, the
bits of rock and the sand it was carrying along, at
work in the middle of the stream. If you throw anything
into a confined mill-race, you will see that it does
not grate along the sides, but, as it sinks, is forced into
the middle, and swept along the middle, of the
stream, there being a pressure on it from both sides.
The natural tendency, therefore, is that the erosion of
a rapid stream would be both straight and perpendicular.
You see this in all the gorges where the water is
now, or has at former times been, flowing rapidly.
Only one point remains, Why is the face of the gorge
which looks to the west less perpendicular than that
face which looks to the east? This also may be explained.
The afternoon sun shines with sufficient
force on the western-looking cliff to melt the snow on
its summit, and some little way down. As soon as
the sun is withdrawn the water from the melted snow
may be recongealed. These alternations of thawing
and freezing are a cause that is at work every spring to
disintegrate the rock on the side that faces west.
This cause is not at work on the side that faces east;
that, therefore, remains perpendicular. The other
side, however, which is acted on by this cause, has
receded a little, and become somewhat inclined. Had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
there been no frosts, there would have been no
weathering of this side, which would then have remained
throughout, with the exception of the few
places where little lateral streams enter the gorge
from this side, as perpendicular as the other side.
The rain also being generally on the west-looking
side, helps to bring down the disintegrated rubble,
and dislodged rocks, to the bottom of the gorge,
where the Tamina immediately, if it cannot sweep
them away, begins to wear them away.</p>

<p>As to the Baths of Pfäffers, those I mean near the
head of the gorge: while at a second breakfast there
at 9.30 I thought the appearance of the servants did
not say much for the salubrity of the place. They
looked fleshless, bloodless, nerveless. But this was
no more than you might expect to see in people who
had been living for two or three months in so damp
and deep a hole. The owner of the establishment
ought to change his servants every Saturday night,
otherwise they will, or at all events they ought to,
scare away his visitors; their pale and emaciated
faces are so many finger-posts, on which is written
the word dangerous. No breath of air can reach the
house. If the stagnation of the air is what in ordinary
valleys produces <i>goîtres</i>, what must its stagnation
in this wet gorge be capable of producing? If
the exterior of the house were not frequently rewhite-washed
it would, I suppose, be covered with the
lichens and moss, and such like damp growths as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
may see on the wall by its side. It may, however, be
argued that the actual baths must be a prophylactic
against rheumatism, because many of those who have
been here a week are still able to walk away.</p>

<p>I spent four hours at Ragatz. It is a loosely put
together place, consisting very much of large hotels
in the style of Interlaken. The interstices, as it is
rapidly increasing in population, will probably soon
be filled up. The water of Pfäffers is brought down
to the town in a wooden pipe two and a half miles
long. This water and the gorge are the sources of
the prosperity of Ragatz. As to Pfäffers, it is worth
seeing. As to the water it may possibly do no harm
to drink it. It issues from the rock at a temperature
of about a hundred degrees. This appears to be its
only peculiarity; at all events it smells and tastes, we
are told, like any other water. No one seemed to
know what, if any, therapeutic ingredients it possesses,
or what are the maladies in the treatment of which it
may be held to be efficacious. These, however, are
not the only ways in which it may be regarded. If
it can give any sufferer an excuse for hope, so far
well, unless it should prevent his having recourse at
the same time to some other rational treatment of his
ailment. Or if it give an excuse to some for leaving
too fast, or too slow, a home, and to others for withdrawing
themselves from overwork, for a time, that
also may be set down to the credit side of the
account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>In the evening I went by rail to Coire. As I
passed along the broad valley of the Rhine, I saw
several mountains cut down almost as perpendicularly
as the gorge at Pfäffers. To the thought, though of
course not to the unthinking eye, the valley is more
impressive than the gorge. Here mountains have
been planed down by old world glaciers, and cut
through by still existing streams, to such an extent as
to form a valley in places two miles wide. The face
of many of the mountains is still a precipice. In
many the precipice at the top has been slanted back
by the weather, and the chips falling to the bottom
have continued the incline in the form of a long <i>talus</i>,
which still remains only because in all the centuries
that have passed since the chips began to accumulate,
the stream has never been working on that side.
These are grander operations, and they contain more
elements of interest to the thought, than the narrow
ravine of Pfäffers.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>August 23.</i>—At Coire I had got back to a point
already passed in my outward course. Among the
guests of the hotel, who were taking an early breakfast
to be in time for the early diligence, was a German
of the Hercynian forest type. There was an item in
his bill of which he did not approve. At the sight
of this entry his wrath kindled in a moment. He
was not satisfied with assailing the waiters, he must
have the manager before him. The manager came.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
The grievance was detailed with much emphasis. Its
enormity was dwelt upon. But the manager was not
taken by surprise. He was as firm as a rock, and
with a surface as incapable of being ruffled. Again
the Teuton returned to the assault. Again the
manager received it unmoved. How the conflict
ended cannot be recorded, for at this point I left the
room.</p>

<p>This German was not more irascible than two of
our young compatriots, their ages might have been
between twenty-five and thirty, whom I had lately
met, were impassive. I sat opposite to them at supper.
To each other they had hardly a word to say. Observing
this I addressed to them an occasional remark
or two. Their replies, however, were seldom more
than monosyllabic. They were as indisposed to talk
to a stranger as to each other. The next day I sat
for several hours in the diligence with them. During
the whole of that time, the least taciturn of the two
only twice uttered a word. Looking at his watch,
which was ostensibly his chief employment, he announced
to his companion that it was nine o’clock.
Some time later, while we were changing horses, he
looked out of the window, and announced in tones
expressive of interest suddenly awakened, that a
<i>supplément</i> was being got ready. I heard the sound
of his more taciturn companion’s voice but once. A
Swiss gentleman, who was seated opposite to him, endeavoured
to direct his attention to a very celebrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
mountain which happened at the moment to be in
sight. ‘Oh!’ was his reply, but it was addressed not
so much to the gentleman who had just spoken to
him as to vacancy, ‘oh! we have had enough of
walking.’ Of course exhibitions of this kind are no
evidence of a national inferiority in natural gifts.
They do, however, suggest a suspicion of the inadequacy
of our eight-parts-of-speech system of education.
To these two young gentlemen nature may
have been not less bountiful in her gifts, or, if the
German observation that nature has given to Germans
industry, but to Englishmen genius, be true, may
have been even more bountiful, than to most men;
and if so, then the fault may not have been so much
in them, as in the system to which they had presumably
been sacrificed: possibly they had not been
fairly dealt with. The improbability of any other
conclusion arises from this, that if their state of mind
was not natural, and we can hardly regard it as
natural, it must have been produced artificially.</p>

<p>At Dissentis, too, which I reached this day at 1
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, I was still on old ground. My object in stopping
here was to get a porter for a walk by the Lukmanier
road, the Uomo Pass, Altanca, and Val Bedretto to
the Gries glacier, with the descent from which into the
Rhone Valley at Ulrichen my excursion would end.
As soon as I had reached Dissentis I requested the
manager of the hotel to get me the best guide in the
place, asking him so to interpret best as to give intelligence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
a prominent place in his estimate: because
what I wanted was not merely a two-legged pack-horse,
but a man with whom it would also be pleasant
to carry on a conversation of four days’ duration. He
knew, he said, exactly what I wanted, and a man who
would completely meet my requirements—a man in
every respect good, but in respect of intelligence exceptionally
good. This was promising; so the possessor
of these good qualities was summoned forthwith,
and it was agreed that we should, at 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, start
for Perdatsch, ten and a half miles on the way to the
Lukmanier, which would be enough for an evening
walk. The man’s get-up was elaborate for a guide;
and there was a jauntiness in his manner, and, as it
struck me, an expression of wiliness in his eye, which
suggested to me the thought that it would be as well
to put the agreement between us into black and white;
and this I accordingly did. He returned half an hour
later than the time fixed for starting. We had not
got clear of the village before he had informed me
that he regarded priests as <i>canaille</i> of the first class.
Such was his form of the superlative of that already
vigorous superlative of contempt. Why, I asked, did
he give them this pre-eminent position? Because,
he replied, they did no work at all, and lived better
than he did. The fact was that he did not recognize,
because he could not understand, that there was any
kind of work in the world, except manual labour.
He then passed on to the landlords of hotels, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
only well-to-do class he was acquainted with in his
own neighbourhood, and included them in the same
category: they too were <i>canaille</i>. In their case, however,
he did not add his superlative suffix. The real
reason of his dislike to them appeared to be that they
had more capital than himself; for he had only enough
to keep a small shop, while they had enough to keep
hotels. Of course I could only infer that, as I was
unfortunately, or rather heinously, able to pay him
for accompanying me, he was regarding me at that
moment in the same light, and referring me to the
same class. All this was soon explained. He had
lately returned from Paris, where he had been at the
time of the siege and of the commune; and if he was
not an actually affiliated member of the <i>Internationale</i>,
he was at all events in opinions and sympathy a communist
of the first class. This was not quite the kind
of man I should have myself chosen; but still there
he was by my side, and must remain there for some
days. There was, therefore, nothing to be done now
but to make the best of a bad bargain. I had at all
events an opportunity for studying at leisure the kind
of stuff of which not of course all communists must
be, but of which it is not unlikely that some are,
made.</p>

<p>For the first six miles, that is as far as Platta, our
way was along the new road, which is being made
from Dissentis by the Lukmanier to Olivone. It is a
grand piece of mountain road-making, as may be understood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
from there being eleven tunnels in the first
four miles. This will also indicate the nature of the
ravine, which necessitates such work for the road that
traverses it. The stream below the road is the Mittel
Rhein, which at Dissentis joins the Vorder Rhein—the
main headwater of the Rhine. These new roads,
of which so many are being constructed in Switzerland,
are, I was told, made at the cost partly of the
respective cantons, and partly of the Confederation.
This is as it should be, for they are not of local advantage
only, but are also indispensable for the general
prosperity of the country. Of course there can be
no internal or external exchange of commodities, and
no human circulation either of natives or of foreigners
without roads; and exactly in proportion as roads
are multiplied and improved, are these advantages
extended. No people see this more clearly than the
Swiss. These are questions which their practical lives
and practical education enable them to understand
readily and thoroughly. They are, therefore, always
adding to, and improving their means of communication.
And, as far as I know, there is not in the
country a road for the use of which a toll is charged:
for to their apprehension a toll would be a contradiction
of the very purpose for which the road was made.
It was made to facilitate communication; and the toll
by making communication dearer, has the same effect
in discouraging it that needlessly severe gradients, or
unnecessary circuits of many miles, or a shockingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
bad condition of the roadway itself would have. For
this reason, that is to say, because they see distinctly
what is the object of having roads, they make them
as well as they can be made, keep them in as good
repair as possible, and make the use of them perfectly
free to all.</p>

<p>The scenery is interesting at first in the ravine,
and not the less so afterwards, when you have
emerged from the ravine, and have entered on something
more valley-like, with the mountains standing
somewhat back, and with openings in them to allow
you some glimpses of snowy summits. These, however,
were matters about which the communist felt no
interest. All that he would here talk about was the
profligacy of the government in making the roads.
The local and the general government were equally
culpable, for each raised its funds by taxation. It
was the people who paid for it all. Roads and everything
else, were only excuses for extracting money
from them. It was vain to argue that the roads were
made for the people, and were for them a necessity;
that they increased their resources; enabled many to
live well who had lived miserably before; and increased
the opportunities and comforts of all. Probably
it was just in this that the sting of the road lay:
because for those who had land it raised the value of
their property, and enlarged the opportunities of innkeepers
and such like folk. The wound this inflicted
on the feelings could not be salved by the fact, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
while the road did hurt to no one, it must in their
proportion have benefited even the smallest tradesmen,
for it created a demand for what they had to
sell by bringing buyers, while it also enabled them to
get from a distance, and more cheaply than before,
the commodities in which they dealt. Through such
helps and facilities many petty tradesmen had become
far more flourishing than they were formerly. Of
course there would have been no objection to this last
effect. Had it stood by itself it would have been approved
of. But, then, the movement had not stopped
at this point, but had also benefited innkeepers, and
some other such Tritons; indeed, had made them
Tritons, and that was intolerable.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant walk to Perdatsch. The new
road has not yet got beyond Platta. But there was
nothing to regret in this. The new road was good;
but so also was the old paved horseway. This also one
was glad to see: it was rudely constructed of blocks
and slabs of gneiss, long since worn smooth by many
centuries of local traffic, and the passage over them,
too, of many armies, which in old times, as we are
told, went and returned this way, during the long
period when the Lukmanier, because it was the easiest,
was the most frequented, of all Alpine Passes. It
had been 3.30 when we left Dissentis, and as my companion
had stopped at Platta for twenty minutes for
a <i>chopine</i> of wine, the last gleams of daylight were
dying away as we reached Perdatsch. To be still on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
the tramp at the close of evening gave rise almost to
a new sensation, which, too, was not altogether a
pleasant one; for you seemed to be still at work
when all nature was either going to rest, or counselling
rest. The peasants had returned home, and so had
the goats and cows. Those belonging to the little inn
had come down from the mountain, and, having now
been milked, were taking up their berths for the night
on the lee side of the <i lang="fr">châlet</i>, and contiguous rocks.
It was the hour, not for walking, but for talking, at
your ease, over what had been seen during the day
that was past, and for forming plans for the day that
was coming.</p>

<p>The inn of Perdatsch is well situated. You have
lately been passing several little villages, which had,
successively, been becoming smaller, as the height
had increased, and so the means for supporting life
had decreased. And now at the point where the
stream from the Val Cristallina meets that of the
Medelser Rhein, and at the foot of M. Garviel, which
rises up before you to divide the V. Cristallina from
the Val Medels, stands the little wood-built structure.
Your memory of what is behind, and the sight of
what is in front, suggest to you that you have now
reached the verge of inhabitable altitude. As you
approach Perdatsch, you see that the stream, in the
leap it there takes of a hundred feet, is of considerable
volume; and you find it putting in a claim to
be a Rhine, the Mittel, or Medelser, Rhein; on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
Splügen you had met a second Rhine, the Hinter
Rhein; on the Julier, a third, the Oberhalbstein
Rhein; in Aversthal a fourth, the Averser Rhein;
and you have seen all these joining a fifth, the Vorder
Rhein. Each of the five by assuming the famous
name seems to insist on your remembering that it
bears an important part in the origination of the great
river, or at least is among its first contributories. I
believe, however, that the word in its original signification
was not so much the proper name as the appellative
of a stream, or river. The Rhine may have
meant the river, the flowing water. Etymologists
will say whether it has any blood relationship with
<i>rivus</i>, river, and Rhone, and possibly Eridanus, which
appears to have been the name of a river that emptied
itself into the Baltic, as well as an alias of the Po.
But to propound conjectures without an adequate
knowledge of the subject, in etymology as in other
matters, is easy, and in both senses of the word endless.</p>

<p>This inn was about the smallest <i lang="fr">châlet</i> I ever entered.
The following were its internal arrangements.
The entrance door was at the south-east corner. From
the door were two little passages. The one facing the
door led to the room occupied by the landlord and
his wife. This room might have been nine feet wide
and a dozen in length. The second passage turned
to the right of the door along the wall. It was about
four feet wide. In this passage came first the cooking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
stove; the passage was in fact the kitchen; and then
beyond the cooking stove the door of the reception
room. This was about eleven feet square, and so low
that a tall man could not stand erect in it. Opposite
the door of the landlord’s own room, and rising over
the door of the house, was a ladder, by which one ascended
to a passage corresponding to that which
formed the kitchen. At the further end of this upper
passage was a miniature bed, which my guide will
occupy to-night. Close to his crib was the door which
opened into the guests’ bedroom. This was the
largest room in the house. It contained three beds.
Its extent, however, was only in area, for it was so
low that it required some manœuvring to get into
bed, and I could not have attempted to sit up in bed
without knocking my head against the ceiling. This
was the whole structure, which to-night will shelter
thirteen mortals. <i lang="la">Absit omen!</i></p>

<p>On my arrival I found a solitary Frenchman—the
only Frenchman I met during this expedition—in
possession of the little parlour. He had left Dissentis
an hour earlier than I; I had, however, seen him
there, and as we were in the same hotel, and bound
for the same place, I had addressed a few words to
him; but he had then appeared to be indisposed to
engage in conversation. I now found him full of
conversation, and a pleasant man to talk with. He
told me that he was a member of the French Alpine
Club; that its members had made so few ascents that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
he was desirous of doing something, and so that he
had come out to get into training for an ascent of
Mount Blanc; but that he did not contemplate
making the attempt till next year. He was a stout
and sturdy but rather short man of about thirty-four
years of age. He carried his knapsack himself.</p>

<p>The usual question now arose, What could we
have for supper? In so small a house, so far from
the world, we did not expect to find much. We,
therefore, summoned the landlord, and asked him to
give us a list of everything in the way of eatables and
drinkables his house contained. He had dried beef,
and also dried mutton: the latter was quite a novelty
to both of us. His wife could make soup. She
could also fry eggs in butter. He had, too, Piora
cheese, not of course actual Piora, but equally of
course quite as good, wine, white bread, and
coffee. He was congratulated on having so many
good things, and such a wife; and requested to place
every one of the good things on the table as soon as
his wife could prepare them. The cembra fire was
kindled, and its cooking power got up, as soon as the
match was put to it; and so in about half an hour,
there being hardly room on the little table for all the
viands, supper was served. We found there was no
reason why we should desert our old acquaintance, the
dried beef, for our new acquaintance, the dried mutton.
The soup was an instance of the deceptiveness of
words. It had no more resemblance to the Tauffers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
mess of herbs, spice, and macaroni than chicken broth
has to the ambrosia of terrapin or turtle. It had but
two ingredients, and those were rice and milk; enough
of the latter to float the former. It was an undecided
question whether the eggs would not have been better
without the butter. The plain butter and the
Pioresque cheese were good. The white bread was
an old world petrifaction. The wine was acid, if not
sour. The coffee was good, as was the milk that
accompanied it. On the whole we were content.
Things were far better than we might have anticipated.
We loitered over them; and it was 10 o’clock—a
late hour for such places, and for such work as
we were engaged in—before we went up the ladder,
and crept into our cribs.</p>

<p>I had not been long in the house before eight
peasants arrived for the night. They walked into the
reception room. We, however, were already in
possession. There was hardly standing space for
them all; and it was evident that there was no space
for another table, and benches, for so many. The
landlord and his wife were equal to the occasion; and
the peasants being reasonable people at once recognized
the necessities of the situation, and accepted
the alternative the host offered them till we might
retire to bed. They had, too, come to make a night
of it, and would not be disappointed. Besides there
was nowhere else to go. The alternative was that
they might have for the present our host’s and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
wife’s bedroom. To this, then, they withdrew, and
forthwith commenced playing at cards and drinking,
transferring themselves to the reception room when
we left it. There they remained till 3 o’clock in the
morning; at which hour they quitted the house, to
proceed further up the mountains to make hay. They
were Platta men, and the foreman of the party was
the Platta schoolmaster, a tall wiry man, with a black
bushy beard. At times during the night we were
woke by their shouts and laughter, as the fortunes of
their game varied. The stakes they were playing for
was the wine they were drinking, for which the losers
had to pay. When disturbed by their merriment, I
cannot say that I was lulled again to sleep—the effect
was rather in the opposite direction—by the rude
bluster of the stream, which was tumbling down its
rocky channel not many yards from my head—still
I had no wish that either the merrymakers or the
stream were further off.</p>

<p><i>August 24.</i>—Last night I had proposed that we
should start this morning at 5—my usual hour for
getting under weigh. But as my proposal appeared
to be objectionable to the communist I withdrew it,
and told him that we would breakfast at 5.45, and be
off at 6. At 5.45, as I left my room, I saw that he
was still asleep in his crib in the upper passage.
While sitting down to breakfast I requested the
landlord to make him get up. After breakfast I
asked for the bill. The landlord left the room to
make it out with the aid of his wife. As the room
was very small, and they were only just beyond the
open door, I could not but hear what passed. They
agreed between them that the charge should be 4
francs. I then found that my man had descended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
the ladder, for I heard him suggest that they should
write 5 francs. A little after 6 we got under weigh.
Having crossed the stream of the Val Cristallina, and
rounded the foot of M. Garviel, over large blocks of
gneiss, we entered the long upper stage of the Val
Medels. It is a grand valley about 6 miles in length.
The only buildings it contains are the three small
refuges of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Gion, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Gall, and Santa Maria. The
ascent is gradual, for in the 6 miles you only rise
about 1,000 feet—from 5,036 at Perdatsch to 6,243 at
Santa Maria. There is no bottom land in it capable
of being mown for hay. This results from the rocks,
with which it is thickly strewn, being so large that
they could not be removed for levelling the ground.
Its lofty ranges stand some way back from each other.
The concavity of the valley is grandly simple. The
long lines of descent sweep down from the summits of
the two ridges to meet in the stream of the Mittel Rhein.
At first, and high up, the descent of these lines is
steep, but all the way down the steepness is lessening, at
an even rate of diminution, till they almost come to a
level in the bottom at their point of contact. In this
long open valley there are no trees, though we are
told that the name Lukmanier (<i lang="la">Lucus magnus</i>)
implies that there were once many. If ever it were
so, their place has now been taken by tufts of dwarf
alder, and of dwarf juniper, which rise only a foot or
two from the ground, and at the lower part of the
valley thickly stud the hillsides. The alder dies out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
after a time, but the juniper continues, though in ever
lessening amount, to the further end. As this long
valley is throughout pretty well turfed, it must be
capable of maintaining during the few months it is
free from snow, a great amount of stock. I saw in it
some large flocks and herds.</p>

<p>My companion appeared to take no interest in the
scene, or in the people; and this morning I was not
disposed to take much interest in him, and so I left
him very much to himself. At last he began of his
own suggestion to talk about our fellow-traveller of
last night, his thoughts still running on Paris. He
wished to know whether I had discovered who our
fellow-traveller was, or whether he had himself told
me. Yes, I replied, he had told me that he was a
Frenchman. ‘A Frenchman!’ he exclaimed; ‘he
was an accursed Prussian spy. You could see it in
his face. You could see it in his maps. You could
see it in his being alone. He had been sent from
Berlin to map the country, that the Prussians might
know beforehand to what account the Lukmanier
might be turned, should the Pass ever in any way be
needed in any coming war. A Frenchman! What
Frenchman ever could speak both German and
English? But many Germans could speak both
English and French. He was an accursed Prussian
spy. The French it was who had gained all the glory
of the late war. They had shown that they were the
braver of the two people. They had not employed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
spies, nor had they trusted to gold.’ This was meant
for England. ‘In the next war they would crush the
accursed Prussians.’</p>

<p>And so we reached Santa Maria—a hospice which
is much cleaner and more commodious inside than you
would expect from the outside. I should not have
entered it had not my miso-Prussian companion
thought that his two hours’ walk had earned him a
half hour’s halt and a <i>chopine</i> of wine. It was as fine
a morning as nature could put together at this elevation.
No ingredient required for the composition had
been stinted. The sun was shining brightly. The air
was fresh, and crisp; for its current, as is the rule on
quiet mornings till about 9 o’clock, was down from the
snowy tops around. When the valley after 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
begins to get heated, the current is reversed, and continues
upward till about 4 or 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> In the sunshine
the warmth felt like a kind of subtle ether, which
permeated one’s whole system, for the moment you
were out of it, you felt the want of it; and the moment
you returned to it, you felt again, throughout your
whole frame, the influence of the all-pervading fluid.
I sat on a rock on the sunny side of the cheese-house,
in front of the hospice. Immediately behind the
hospice was the long flank of a greenish brown, and
the snowy summit, of the Scopi, nearly 1,450 feet
above me. Straight before me, twenty minutes off,
was the summit of the Lukmanier Pass, only 250 feet
higher than my seat. To the right, at the distance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
an hour and a half, and 1,200 feet higher, was the
Uomo Pass. It was a grand and impressive mountain
scene. There was at the time in sight a party of
Italians bringing bags of salt on their asses down the
Lukmanier, and showing in the distance no bigger
than mice. The salt was for distribution among the
cheese-makers of this, and of the contiguous valleys.
For how many centuries had salt travelled that way!
What a large part had its traffic played in the early
communications of mankind! How surely does what
is wanted wear for itself a way. This commodity is
bulky, and but little is to be gained by bringing it,
and yet the supply has never failed. But here the
days of the traffic in its present form are now
numbered, for the new road is all staked out; and
when it shall be made, these asses laden with salt will
no longer come down the Lukmanier, accompanied by
their shaggy owners. Salt, however, will be cheaper
in V. Medels, and V. Cristallina, and the other valleys
of this group of mountains. Some figures that now
add a suggestion to the scene, will have disappeared
from it; but human life will have become a little
easier and better supplied, and that not in salt only,
but in many other things besides.</p>

<p>Half an hour having passed with some discontent,
though on the balance of the whole without much
reason for it, we began the ascent of the Uomo. It
would be worth walking up it were it only to see in
some of the little rock basins of its stream, when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
are about two-thirds of the way up, how wonderfully
transparent water can become, or rather is before it
has become charged in one way or another with
extraneous matters. On reaching the summit you
there find that the water cannot readily get away on
account of the number of little depressions spread over
the surface. Here, therefore, it is rather swampy.
These depressions have, perhaps, been caused by the
concussion of falling avalanches. Where the momentum
of such masses in motion is arrested, some soil
must be thrown out, and a depression formed, which
same soil perhaps is again thrown back by the subsequent
fall of other avalanches to the right or left. By
action of this kind the whole surface may be kept in
a swampy state. This swampy summit is a common
watershed both for the Rhine and for the Po, so that
you are uncertain whether the little pool before you
will send its overflow to the North sea, or to the
Adriatic, or divide it between the two.</p>

<p>On leaving the summit you turn to the right, your
path at first being on the mid flank of the mountain
which forms the northern range of the Val Piora, on
which you now enter. Hitherto Piora has been known
only for its cheese; but I am disposed to think that
the day is coming, when it will have a place in the
memories of the eye as well as of the palate. As you
take your first glance down the valley, you see beyond
it the grand group of the <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Gothard, standing up
well before you, gray-sided, many-peaked, precipitous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
and snowy, looking down on the lesser heights of the
Val Canaria. As you descend the valley, you ask
why its cheese should have become so famous? You
find the answer beneath your feet. Its wholesome-looking
turf is rooted in disintegrated limestone. If,
then, it be true that good horses cannot be bred
except on limestone pastures, and that even the human
organism is the better for having, as we may say, been
bred at second, or third hand upon them, through its
vegetable and animal food, then we can understand
how it comes about that the cheese of Piora takes
high rank in the order of merit. I recollect having
heard more than thirty years ago the Sir George
Crewe of those days affirm, that when he left home he
generally missed in the vegetables served at his dinner
the flavour, which a dressing of lime imparted to the
same sorts, when grown in his own garden at Calke
Abbey. People then thought this fanciful; it was,
however, an anticipation of what we are now told is
demonstrable. He at all events would not have
overlooked its limestone pastures in endeavouring to
account for the merits of Piora cheese.</p>

<p>At what, till you reach it, appears to be the lower
end of the valley, you find a small lake, with a village
on its further shore. To the left of the lake, and
somewhat above it, is one of the chief cheese-stores of
Piora. It is a roomy stone structure, partially sunk
in the ground, with the view of keeping its temperature
equable. I cannot say how many cheeses I saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
in it; but there were a great many, and they weighed
about fifty pounds each, and their wholesale price was
eighty cents a pound. From this point, bearing to
the left, and descending to a lower level, you reach a
second lake of a blue-green colour, about a mile in
length. Its name is Ritom. You pass along its right-hand
shore, at the bottom of a steep range, from
which you see that rocks must frequently be detached
in spring. At about the middle of the path along the
lake is a second store for Piora cheese. The cheeses
are made on the Alps, and are brought to these storehouses
to mature. Here we again stopped. At both
of these storehouses we found two men in charge.
Our object now was to make inquiries about Altanca,
a village on the northern ridge of the Val Leventina,
where I proposed to spend the afternoon, and to stop
for the night. I had been told at Dissentis, by a
horse-dealer who frequented these valleys in the way
of his business, that at Altanca the only person who
undertook to provide accommodation for travellers was
the Curé. As we were now drawing near to the place
I thought that I might here get some definite information
on this point. The head cheese-maker, to whom
I addressed myself, might have sat for the model of a
Hercules. I never saw a man who, I could have
supposed, would in the days of clubs and spears have
had a better chance in encounters with hundred-headed
hydras, gigantic boars, and man-eating lions. His
features, which were garnished by a thick, curly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
black beard, though large, were not at all coarse, but
only in fair proportion to his massive frame. To my
inquiries about the capabilities of the Curé’s establishment,
he replied that the Curé himself was old, and
deaf, and that he had three sisters of about his own
age residing with him. I noticed the indirectness of
his reply, which left it to me to draw for myself from
the particulars he had given whatever inferences I
pleased, and thought that there was rather more of
diplomacy in this than I should have expected in a
mountain cow-herd. Taking it, however, to imply
that an evening spent with the deaf old Curé and his
three equæval sisters would not be a lively one, I
asked him if he could put me in the way of finding
something more promising. ‘I can commend to you,’
he replied, ‘a <i>Parisienne</i>.’ It was clear from his look,
as well as from his confining himself to that single word,
that he knew very well what were the ideas it called
up in people’s minds—vivacity, as much as could be
maintained at Altanca, good cookery, as far as the
materials of Altanca admitted, and some mementos
of a more embellished mode of life than was native to
Altanca. Of course I was obliged to him, and would
entrust myself to the <i>Parisienne</i>. On my offering
him a glass of Scotch whisky, of which I had a flask
with me, he saw that I was a Britisher, and replied in
English. His story was that he had gone out to
California as a digger, and there it was that he had
picked up his modicum of French and English, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
his knowledge of the world. After some years of
digging, he had found that gold was no compensation
for absence from his native mountains. Hercules in
the garden of the Hesperides was pining for houseless
and treeless Piora; and so he had returned, and
become a cowherd once more on the borders of the
blue lake, and at the foot of the craggy mountain.
As I left him, I thought how much more tender
his heart was than his hand, which I felt could
have crushed mine almost as easily as it could an
egg-shell.</p>

<p>At the foot of the lake I came upon an hotel in
construction. It was nearly completed. There were
at work upon it forty-six Italian masons and carpenters.
The architect, and the future landlord, were
present superintending and expediting the work.
The old Curé, too, who had come up from Altanca,
was seated on a rock close by, alone, watching its
progress. Perhaps he was thinking that a new order
of things was about to commence; that Altanca was
about to be introduced to the world, and the world to
Altanca; that the quietude of centuries was about to
end; that troublous times might be coming: but if
so that it would be his successor that would have to
deal with them. Perhaps also the Curé of Altanca
may have wondered where the fifty guests, who it is
hoped will fill the fifty beds of this hotel, are to come
from. Those, however, who are aware that there will
be no difficulty in finding many fifties who are ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
to come, will be rather disposed to ask how they are
to get to the hotel? People hereabouts say, that when
the road over the Lukmanier shall be completed,
there will be taken in hand a branch from it over the
Uomo, down the Piora, and by Altanca to Val
Leventina. This is probable enough, for one improvement
generally suggests, and leads on to others,
which in fact it renders possible. The road, however,
from this hotel by Altanca to Val Leventina will be
a very difficult piece of engineering, for it will be
down an unusually steep descent of 2,500 feet.</p>

<p>The existing horse-track from the hotel at the
foot of the lake down to Altanca covers about half
of these 2,500 feet. Though steep it is for the most
part paved, and must have been a great undertaking
for so small a community, for it comprises only
twenty-five families; and all this was done to enable
these poor villagers to send their cows up to the
mountain pastures, and to bring down their produce.
It was one more instance, and, though you have
instances of it everywhere in Switzerland, a very
striking one, of how much people will do, when they
are working for themselves. The road was to be
made, if it ever could be made, to enable them to
send their own cows to their own pastures, and therefore
it was that the arduous work was taken in hand,
and carried through. In places the road is along the
edge of a grand ravine, at the bottom of which is the
stream that drains the lake into the Ticino. It has two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
very fine cascades. One of the mountains that rises
above it is Hadrian’s tomb expanded into a mountain.</p>

<p>And now we are at Altanca. Just above it are
some little prairies and small pine woods. Wherever
there was a chance that a tree might be able to
hold on, one had been persuaded to make the attempt;
and wherever there was a chance that a little soil
might be able to hold on, an attempt had been made
to form a prairie. The village itself is on a ledge of
rock. About fifty feet below it is a little area of some
dozen acres, sufficiently level for spade husbandry.
Here the twenty-five families grow their little patches
of rye, cabbages, and potatoes. It was now towards
the end of August, and so their busiest time. The rye
harvest, and the hay harvest, were both being brought
home; and this glorious day would perhaps be the
busiest of their brief summer. We found all the
houses closed. In the village no one was to be seen.
Everyone was in the field. Almost the first house we
passed was the Curé’s: surely one of the three
sisters would be at home, though, indeed, I had some
disinclination to tapping at the door, for conscience
told me that I was deserting the recognised host of
the place for selfish reasons, that it would hurt the
feelings of the sisterhood to find that I was in search
of entertainment elsewhere, and that there would be
something cruel in selecting them of all people for
such inquiries. It was, therefore, a relief to find that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
they, too, were in the field. On such a day to have
remained within doors at Altanca would have been a
reproach. I might have guessed that they were not
at home, for a large bundle of hay in a hempen sheet
had been deposited on the door-step. Some fifty
yards below this house was a row of twenty-barred
<i>kraschners</i>, the kind of gigantic clothes-horses on
which at these altitudes corn is stacked and dried in
sheaf. About a dozen of the dames and maidens of
Altanca were clambering up the bars of these
<i>kraschners</i>, with loads of sheaves on their shoulders,
and packing them away between the bars. They
do not work from top to bottom, but from end to
end, beginning at the bottom. A few sheaves are put
in over the bottom bar. Of these only the heads are
passed through the opening between the two bars.
The sheaves are then bent on the bar so that their
long butt-ends hang down. In each row all the head
ends are on one side, and all the butt-ends on the
other. The heads and butt-ends of the alternate rows
being reversed, the long butt-ends of each row, as
you ascend from bottom to top, completely protect from
wet the short head ends of the row below it. Of course
when the whole is full, no head ends are seen on
either side, all being covered, as it were thatched, by
the rows of butt-ends. The topmost row is protected
either by a wooden ridge, or by a little straw. Our
appearance on the scene, as might have been expected,
caused an instantaneous suspension of work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
Those who were going aloft with loads on their backs,
and those who were thrusting into their places the
sheaves that had been brought to them, came to a
standstill as they were made aware from below of the
unwonted intrusion. Everyone seemed to know the
<i>Parisienne</i>, and so the interruption did not last many
moments.</p>

<p>This busy quarter of Altanca was at its extreme
east. The <i>Parisienne’s</i> mansion was at the west end.
We soon reached it, for here distances are not great.
The front door opened on the kitchen and store-room.
You passed through this and entered the ‘keeping’
room, a large and tidy room for a <i lang="fr">châlet</i>. It did,
however, also contain a bed in an obscure corner.
No one was at home. But the master of the house
was soon summoned. He had spent his days of
foreign sojourn at Paris, where he had made the
money which he had spent on his house, and where
he had also found his wife, and learnt to speak
French. He immediately produced a bottle of wholesome
wine, some mummy beef, and petrified white
bread. I asked for fresh rye-bread and Piora cheese.
He assured us that his wife would be at home early
in the evening, and would do all she could for us.
He had a new bedroom which he would place at my
disposal. Fortunately it had but one bed. He
would, therefore, procure a bed for the communist in
a neighbouring <i lang="fr">châlet</i>. He was a tall handsome man,
as almost all the men are in these valleys. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
despatched a messenger for his nephew to spend the
evening with me, for he was one who had seen much
of the world; he could, too, speak English.</p>

<p>At last evening came, and with it the nephew, and
the long expected <i>Parisienne</i>. Her first thought was
to offer me a pair of slippers, and to ask me to take
off my boots. As is the case with so many of her
countrywomen in middle-age she had lost her figure,
but had retained her vivacity. She was full of lively
talk, and, to be Irish, equally so of good nature. She
would do all she could, but, as an aside, Altanca was
not Paris. During my stay in this house I had this
aside in many forms, and <i lang="la">à propos</i> to many matters.
But though, as she impressed on me, Altanca was not
Paris, she did what she could to show that it had not
extinguished her recollections of Paris. It was
pleasant in such a place, and under such circumstances,
to hear what in some degree reminded one of
French <i lang="fr">esprit</i>, and of the neatness of French expression.
As was natural, too, in a Frenchwoman, she
was proud of her <i>potage</i>. I thought it rather salt. The
stock probably had been made of dried salt beef.
‘Excuse me, monsieur, the French kitchen is even
more <i>salée</i> than the Swiss.’</p>

<p>‘Madame, you are right. The <i>potage</i> is excellent;
and to-morrow at All’ Acqua, and often in the future
elsewhere, I shall have reason to recall its merits,
which will ever be accompanied with pleasing recollections
of its maker.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span></p>

<p>If the cheesemaker of Ritom might have sat for a
model of Hercules, the nephew of our host might
have sat for a model of Apollo. He was tall, clean-built,
and strong-limbed, without showing much
muscular development. His features were regular,
and finely-chiselled, and full of thought. His voice was
clear and musical. And yet he was only a carpenter
of Altanca, who had just returned to see his family, after
having followed his trade for nine years in California.
Below the window at which we were sitting were the
few acres of the corn and garden ground of the
twenty-five families of Altanca. As we looked out
upon it, watching the people at work in the gloaming,
I knew what thoughts were passing through his mind,
and so, addressing myself to them, I said, ‘That little
bit of land would be but a neglected corner in a
Californian farm.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he replied; ‘things are on a very small
scale here. But that is not all. There is no liberty
here.’</p>

<p>‘How?’ I asked. ‘The people here manage their
own affairs as completely as they do in California.
Both are equally republican.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he again replied, ‘but it is so only in form.
There is no liberty here.’</p>

<p>He meant liberty of opinion, and scope for action.</p>

<p><i>August 25.</i>—The <i>Parisienne’s</i> estimate of the
services that had been rendered to me was nine francs:
a low estimate if compared with English charges;
still for some even of it I was indebted to the communist,
as I was also for my not being able to get
away before six o’clock. Our destination was All’
Acqua, at the head of the Val Bedretto. As we left
Altanca I found that many of the goats and cows of
the place were suffering from the foot and mouth
disease, that has of late years been very troublesome
here among our own herds. It was sad to find such
a calamity lessening the resources—and their cows
and goats are their chief resource—of these hard-working
and scantily provided people. The view, as
we began to descend to the valley of the Ticino, was
very grand, as it had been from Lake Ritom down to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
Altanca—far grander, indeed, than anything you can
see from the valley itself. Between the village and
the valley the path is all the way over very steep reclaimed
grass land. To reclaim it had been the
labour of many generations. The dusty road of the
hot valley was a poor exchange for the Medelserthal,
the Uomo, the Piora, the Ritom, and the Altanca of
yesterday. We had not, however, much of it, for we
were to leave it at Airolo. At Airolo, however, I
was provokingly detained for half an hour by my
thirsty and lazy attendant, who could not, after a walk
of only an hour and a half in the early morning, pass
a wine-shop without turning into it. The long main
street of Airolo was up, just as if it had been Cheapside,
in order that an iron water-main might be laid
down in it, in anticipation of its coming wants, when
the railway beneath the <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Gothard shall be opened.</p>

<p>A troop of artillery passed through the place.
They had been out somewhere near Andermatt for
their summer manœuvres. Yesterday at Piora we
had heard the booming of their guns. I thought of
them, and of the national force to which they belonged,
in connection with the railway. Switzerland was
strong when it was self-contained, and when a large
part of the country was almost inaccessible. This
was what enabled it to establish its independence.
It could support itself, and its enemies could not get
at it. Now, however, it is not self-contained, for it
is very largely dependent on trade and travellers. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
can no longer produce its own food, but must look to
trade and travellers for the means of purchasing a
large portion of its daily bread. If, then, the railways
that bring these travellers, and the cotton, the
wool, and the silk its factories work up, and carry to
their markets the manufactured fabrics, and which,
too, bring a considerable proportion of its daily bread,
were held by an enemy, the country would be starved
into submission. This might be done in two or three
years without firing many guns, or much fighting.
Nor if an enemy should desire to invade it, would
any part of the country be inaccessible. Railways
and roads have opened the whole of it. Either, then,
it might be starved into submission by having its
supplies cut off, or the enemy might take advantage
of the means of communication it has already constructed,
and to which it is still adding, to make himself
master of its strongholds, and chief centres of
population. Modern Switzerland, therefore, is now no
stronger than any other part of Europe: indeed, not so
strong as many of its more behindhand districts. All
the grand appliances of modern science, wealth, and
organization, such as railways, gas-works, water-works,
large factories, extensive commerce, banking
facilities, must in future wars be so many sources of
weakness to the weaker powers, that is to those who
are not strong enough to protect the costly material
mechanism of modern civilization. The strength with
which nature had endowed Switzerland under the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
condition of things has under their existing condition
been well-nigh completely cancelled. This may in
proportion be applied generally to the whole Continent,
with the single exception of its strongest nation,
for the weaker are now in a degree and manner peculiar
to these times at the mercy of the strongest.
This suggests the question, what will be the eventual
result of the developments of science and wealth
having made the weaker nations almost powerless,
and the strongest nation almost omnipotent?</p>

<p>It was pleasant on this sunny morning to get out
of the stifling heat of Airolo. Before we could enter
the Val Bedretto we had to cross the Ticino, close to
the mouth of the railway tunnel. Here was presented
to us a very busy scene, which showed how much
work was doing, and would have to be done. No
sooner had we entered the Val Bedretto than we were
met by a current of crisply fresh air descending it.
There is nothing to a cursory glance particularly
striking in this valley. Still it has its own features;
but if I were to attempt to put them into words the
description would appear to be not unlike that of
many another Alpine valley. This, however, would
be an injustice; its pathway, its forests, its villages,
its mountains, the rents in its mountains, some of
them very deep, and from the colour of the rock
almost of a pure white, the main valley itself, its
laterals, and its broad pebbly stream, have each and
all their own character, and quite enough to interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
and satisfy the mind; at least I have never found a
Swiss valley, and certainly did not find the Val Bedretto,
uninteresting; even though, as it happened, I
had to stop for a quarter of an hour at Fontana, and
again for half an hour at Villa for those ever-craved,
and never-satisfying <i>chopines</i> of wine. This annoyance,
however, even if in some degree it amounted to
that, was one of very small dimensions: it was not,
for instance, to be compared in respect of any inconvenience
that attended it, with a high wind, or a
smart shower, or even an overclouded sky, or still
less with a battered foot. At all events, all is well
that ends well; and so I thought, as early in the
afternoon we reached our day’s halting place at All’
Acqua, though not at first knowing the good-fortune
that was awaiting me there; for I had now, without
the least anticipation that it would be so, heard the
last of those unconscionable <i>chopines</i> of wine.</p>

<p>Here, then, I am in my last little mountain inn.
I have now had my last dinner of macaroni soup, and
of crude beef, and am sitting outside in the bright
sun, very pleasant at this height, and am noting the
composition of the scene. The little house stands
some hundreds of feet above the Ticino, on the left
bank. The stream, though lost to sight, is still heard
from down below. Beyond it, on the opposite side,
are steep mountains, clothed on their lower flanks
with more or less detached larch, tufts of dwarf alder,
and patches of grass, to the upper limit of the tree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
line, and then up to the summit with open grass and
rocks. On my side, around me, the foreground is
open pasture strewn with rocks. It is studded with
a few large venerable larch. A small stream threads
its way down it to supply the house with water. This
open, rock-strewn pasture rises into a near line of
wooded mountains, with a few patches of grass. These
constitute the middle distance, beyond the immediate
foreground. They are backed by another quite distinct
line of mountains, which are the background of
this part of the panorama. The second range is in
complete contrast to the first, for it is much loftier,
and steeper, and absolutely naked. Its summits are
in the forms of pyramids, peaks, and cliffs, and
grandly dominate the interposed green range. It is
against the sky line. Down the valley are the snow-patched
finials of the <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Gothard group. Up the
valley are dark scantily-turfed slopes, tipped with
snow. In that direction will lie my path to-morrow.</p>

<p>I returned to the house with three Italians, who
had come from Domo d’Ossola by the Falls of the
Tosa. Their coloured scarfs, patent-leather buskins,
and the rest to match, were more elaborate, and more
designed for artistic effects, than would have been
considered appropriate for mountain work by any
people from the north of the Alps. But they were
engaged in a great undertaking, and this get-up would
magnify it in their friends’, and, too, in their own, eyes.
While they were at dinner the landlord came in to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
ask me, if I would give up to them my guide, who in
that case would accompany them as their guide and
porter in the afternoon back to Airolo, adding that he
would himself, to-morrow, take my man’s place with
me. I was only too happy to hear the proposal. I
declined, however, to have anything to do with the
pecuniary part of the arrangement: that the two
men must settle between themselves. I would pay
my man the whole sum for which he had agreed to
go with me across the Pass to Ulrichen, and he must
pay the landlord for taking his place for the day.
This would be a gain in more ways than one to him,
for he would be paid by the Italians for returning
with them this evening to Airolo, and I would give
him two days’ pay for returning, whereas he could
return from Airolo to Dissentis in one day easily,
having nothing but himself to carry. He would thus
get home two days sooner, get all I had agreed to
give him for the longer time, and what the Italians
would give him for a day, having only, <i lang="la">per contra</i>, to
pay his substitute for one day. At this proposal he
burst into a storm of wrath, and demanded three
days’ pay for returning. This I told him would be
contrary to the contract, even had he gone to Ulrichen.
In his rage he denied that there had ever been any
contract. I produced it. He then took his money;
and much to my satisfaction, I saw no more of ‘the
most intelligent, and in every respect the best guide
in Dissentis.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span></p>

<p>The family of the inn comprised six little bare-footed,
bare-headed children. The eldest could
hardly have been more than eight years old; the
youngest was an infant in arms. Their confidence
was readily won by a distribution of ten cent pieces.
The infant clutched his piece as tenaciously, and appreciated
it as highly, as the eldest. The good-natured
signora was pleased to find that her little
ones were regarded with some interest, and not as
nuisances. I spent half an hour in the evening in the
dairy to witness the economies of the butter, and of
the cheese making. The good man had a sturdy
female assistant, with broader shoulders than his own,
who accompanied him to the alpe to milk the cows
and to bring home the milk, which was immediately
curded over the fire, and set for cheese of the Pioresque
kind. The milk that had been set for cream,
was now skimmed for butter. The sturdy assistant
churned the cream, while the good man converted
the skimmed milk into meagre cheese. The whey from
both the fat and the meagre curd, was set to the fire
a second time, for the production of the second curd.
This is too soft and poor for cheese. In French
Switzerland it is called serré; here it goes by a name
which is pronounced muscarp, but written <i>mascarpa</i>.
The thin watery whey expressed from this is given to
the pigs, who stand outside, with their snouts thrust
in at the door, to claim their rights. By the time the
whey is ready for them it is almost dark, only just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
enough light remaining to enable you to see that, as
they silently absorb gallon after gallon of the liquid,
they are ‘visibly swelling before your eyes.’ The
muscarp is then carried into the house in a wooden
keeler, and the good man, his prolific wife, the sturdy
female attendant, and the six children, the two eldest
of whom had, to the extent of their capacities assisted
at the butter and the cheese making, sit at the table
round the tub, and with wooden spoons address themselves
to its contents. I take a spoonful. I had not
tasted curds and whey since I was a boy in the West
Indies, where the mess goes by I suppose the Scotch
name of bonnie clabber. To encourage the family
party, for the junket does not quite equal my fancied
recollections, I pronounce it to be good. ‘But,’ quoth
the good man, ‘you would not think so, if it were all
your supper every evening.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>August 26.</i>—At 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> was off with Clemente
Forni. It was as fresh and bright as could be wished
for one’s last morning among the mountains. The
way was over short rock-strewn turf, by the side of
the infant Ticino, with near mountains right and left
and before me. Clemente was of the kind of men
you take to at once, and who give you afterwards no
reason—I will suppose this of him—for changing your
opinion. Everything around, and within, promised
well for a pleasant day on the Gries glacier, which
both last year, and the year before, I had looked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
over the head of the Valais, from the top of the
Grimsel, with a desire for a nearer acquaintance.
From what I had seen of Clemente yesterday he
seemed industrious, thoughtful, gentle, honest, one
who had a head, a heart, and a conscience. Indeed,
the stream of his discursive talk, fed from these fountains,
never ran dry. This made him a man whom it
was pleasant to walk and to talk with. His only
scheming was how he might by his own hard labour
bring up his six little folk, and as many more as
might come. In about an hour and a half we reached
the cheese <i lang="fr">châlet</i> of the Cruina alpe, in a little mountain-locked
bay, well sheltered from every wind. The
sixty-four cows kept upon it had all been milked, and
with but a few exceptions here and there, were all
again lying down, knowing that they should not be
taken for the day to pasture, till the four herdsmen
had made the cheese, and had their own breakfast.</p>

<p>We entered the <i lang="fr">châlet</i>. The milk of the sixty-four
cows was being curded in a gigantic copper caldron,
over a clear smokeless cembra fire. A man of about
six-and-thirty, not tall, but broad and bony, of iron
frame and massive muscles, was in charge of the
caldron. At another fire was another of the party,
preparing a pot of polenta made with cream. The
other two were lying on thick gray blankets at the
further end of the single room. The polenta was
soon ready, and was carried, in the pot in which it
had been made, outside the <i lang="fr">châlet</i>—there was no room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
for the party within—and six one-legged stools set
round it for the four herdsmen, my guide, and myself,
and a round-bowled spoon brought out for each of us.
We ranged ourselves on the one-legged stools around
the pot. One who hails from the south of the Tweed
will probably prefer polenta made with cream to oatmeal
porridge. When they had finished the polenta,
each dipped with a miniature wooden keeler, which
does duty for dish, plate, and basin, out of a large
wooden tub as much muscarp as he would require
for supplementing his first course of polenta. A great
deal of muscarp is made from sixty-four cows, and
it is the work of one of the herdsmen to take this
down daily to All’ Acqua, from whence it is sent on
upon another back to Bedretto. The man who takes
it down to All’ Acqua returns with a load of wood.
On leaving the party I had some difficulty in persuading
the broad-shouldered, brawny-muscled
cheese-maker to accept a franc for his hospitality.</p>

<p>As we passed through the herd one of the cows
that was on her legs came up to us, and rubbed her
head against my guide. ‘That,’ he said, ‘is my cow.’
While she was thus expressing, in her dumb fashion,
her satisfaction at seeing him—there was no hypocrisy
in this recognition—two dun yearling heifers rose
from the ground, and coming up to him, as the cow
had done, began to lick his hand. These also, I
needed not to have been told it, were his. Here was
irrefragable evidence of the gentleness of the good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
man. What a pleasant sight to the cow was the
familiar form and dress! How often had those
yearling heifers eaten from that hand! They had
never been cuffed, or kicked, or sworn at. The wife
and children, too, then, had had, and would continue
to have, done for them all that man could do at All’
Acqua; and so would all who might come in the
good man’s way. Who could help liking and respecting
one, for whom his beasts were showing such confiding
regard, or could fail to be reminded of very different
scenes he had witnessed elsewhere? When a horse
shrinks from the man who has charge of it, you need
not be told in words how he is in the habit of treating
it. No further evidence is needed. On this occasion
I, too, came in for some share of attention, for a goat
that was kept with the herd ran up to me, and,
rubbing her nose on my hand, begged for a pinch of
salt. How gladly would I have complied with her
request! Were I ever again to visit the alpe of
Cruina I would not go without a pinch or two of
salt.</p>

<p>We were now near the head of the Pass. The
grass was beginning to thin out. The marmots were
abroad for their morning feed. As we disturbed them,
they wriggled home with a slow and awkward movement,
for their bodies are long and their legs short;
and when they had reached the door of their runs, so
that they could feel somewhat secure, paused for a
moment or two to make out the designs of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
intruders. Just before us was the Corno glacier to
which we were approaching, and on to which a few
more steps would take us. We had ascended about
3,000 feet from All’ Acqua, and were now at an
elevation of 8,000 feet. ‘The little sinuous paths of
earthly care’ were far below, and around us were
some of ‘the flowers that embellish’ the pedestrian’s
way, and ‘the springs that refresh’ him at these
heights. One of the former was a pale sky-blue
gentian, a flower that still embellishes memory, as it
did on that day my path, and from one of the latter I
had a rare draught, at the spot where it welled out of
the rock a little below the glacier. And now we are
upon the Corno glacier, itself. It has some peculiarities.
First it is in the form of a saddle, or the
segment of a circle, with the glacier for the arc of the
segment, the chord being underground. In a word it
is convex. This double inclination is one peculiarity.
Another is found in its <i>moraine</i>. As it has no lateral
glaciers to cause medial <i>moraines</i>, you would suppose
that it would have two lateral <i>moraines</i>, and nothing
more. It has, however, nothing of the kind on either
side, but, instead, one large, well compacted, wall-like
<i>moraine</i> some considerable way from the margin.
And now we are struck with another peculiarity. The
glacier on the Gries side is depressed along the middle
in the axis of its length. As, then, the <i>moraine</i> is not
on the margin, we should have expected to find it
following the line of greatest central depression,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
whereas it runs along the face of one of the inclines
midway between the margin and the line of greatest
depression. These, then, are the questions the sight
suggests to us; Why are there not two <i>moraines</i>, one
on each margin of the glacier? How comes it that
the single <i>moraine</i>, which must have been formed
from the mountains above, seeing that it is not on one
of the margins, is not in the line of the central depression?
How comes it to be so compactly and cleanly
built along the middle of the descent of one side
towards the central depression? And what has produced
this central depression? Clemente from his
knowledge of the locality was able to answer all these
questions, I think, satisfactorily. In winter the glacier
is buried in snow to a great depth. At that season,
and in the spring, the snow-inclines from the two
mountains meet not above the line of longitudinal
greatest depression in summer, but exactly along the
line of the <i>moraine</i>. Here in winter and spring is the
line of greatest depression. Every rock, therefore,
that falls from either mountain rolls down to this line,
and is added to the <i>moraine</i>. As a general rule rocks
only fall in winter and spring. This accounts for their
being nowhere except along this line, that is to say
for the strange position of the <i>moraine</i> along the flank
of an incline of ice. In the early spring, when the
snow is beginning to melt, and for some time longer,
the <i>moraine</i> continues to be the line of greatest
depression. At this time, therefore, all the surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
melting flows along it through its open pile of stones:
this accounts for their being washed clean and kept
open. As the summer advances, and the sun becomes
more vertical, the snow is melted away to some
distance below the <i>moraine</i>, and the line of greatest
depression is advanced considerably, along which, as
long as there is any surface snow melting, there is a
stream flowing, which, as long as it lasts, aids in
deepening the central depression. This accounts for
the summer line of depression along the middle of the
glacier, far below the <i>moraine</i>. This glacier, then, as
we said at first, is, when regarded as a whole, of a
convex form; but a transverse section of it on the
Gries side, and taken at a point alongside of the
<i>moraine</i> would be concave. Its position explains its
convexity. It descends on the summit of a gentle
ridge, or if you prefer so to state it, is formed on the
summit of a gentle ridge; it naturally, therefore, flows
down each side of this ridge. I have given Clemente’s
explanation of the singular position of the <i>moraine</i>,
and of the central concavity of the western limb of the
glacier.</p>

<p>Having left the Corno we got upon the Gries by
passing along the flank of the last spur of the mountain
to the north of the Corno glacier. At its extremity,
with the Corno on your left, you command a
grand view of the broad expanse of the Gries. To
this we now descended. It here presents a smooth
surface, rising to the south-west. We passed the line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
of poles, each fixed in a counterpoise of rock to keep
it erect, which mark the horse track across the glacier
from the Upper Valais to Domo d’Ossola. We spent
about an hour upon it, walking up it, in the direction
of the lofty, massive, smooth-faced, umber-coloured
mountain, which protrudes through it to the west of
the track to Domo d’Ossola. We then recovered the
path to Ulrichen.</p>

<p>One goes on a glacier, or goes to see anything, for
the sake of the thoughts the sight will awaken. This
is as much the case with the man who is unconscious,
as with the man who is conscious, of thinking; as
much with the clod as with the philosopher; with the
man who sneers at thought, that is to say all thought
but his own, as with the man who knows that thought
is his life, and himself. Now one of the thoughts that
interest the mind as you stand on this mighty mass
of ice, and know that, as you stand upon it, you and
it are being invisibly, imperceptibly, and regularly
moved on together, is what moves it? That the
movement of the Gries is for local reasons unusually
slow, even for a glacier, heightens the interest of the
question submitted to your thought. I had at that
time a wound on one of my finger-nails, which had
been caused by the bite of a dog two months back.
It had originally been at the root of the nail. But
now it had in the course of those two months advanced
almost to the outer edge of the nail, that is to say it
had with the utmost slowness, but also with the utmost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
regularity, travelled from the inner to the outer edge,
a journey of an inch in two months. Now what had
caused it to move in this way? It was evident that
the whole nail, which appears to be firmly fixed to
the finger, had moved on with it. Day and night the
movement had been going on; but what was it that
had been making it move? I suppose the pressure
from behind caused by the growth of new matter.
This growth of new matter at the root of the nail had
caused continuous pressure from behind. This continuous
pressure had been propagated throughout the
whole extent of the nail, and so had obliged it to
move on. Is not the growth of the upper snow-field,
and the consequent pressure from it, exactly analogous?
Is it not equally continuous? And is it not
similarly propagated throughout the whole glacier?
And, too, with the same result, that is to say is it not
this pressure which obliges the whole mass to move on
in the line of least resistance? The wounded point in
the nail marked the rate of advance, just as a rock on
the surface of the glacier might.</p>

<p>We may see an instance of what continuous pressure
will do in the case of a tree growing near an iron
fence. They at last come in contact, and the pressure
being from the direction of the tree bends the iron.
The comparatively soft bark is not cut into: it is the
iron that gives way. If the pressure had been in the
reverse direction, that is from the iron, the tree would
have been cut into. So with the root of a tree in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
old wall. The pressure being continuous from the
root cracks the wall, though the root is soft and the
wall hard. Some ilexes, which a few years back I
saw growing on the ruins of the Palace of the Cæsars
on the Palatine, supplied good instances of the effect
of this continuous action of soft on hard substances.
Their roots had rent and lifted large masses of what
had previously been solid blocks of the firmest
masonry, that had stood uninjured through so long a
series of centuries, and, had it not been for these roots,
would still have been solid and unmoved. So also
with the expansion of water when freezing in the
cranny of a rock, the expansion of the soft material
burst the hard one. The propagation then of continuous
pressure throughout the mass of the Gries glacier,
although it is four miles long, and one mile broad,
and no one can say how thick, may possibly be
sufficient to account for its being moved on in the
line of least resistance. And if the principle be correct
may it not be applied to glaciers of twenty times the
magnitude of the Gries? that is to say to all glaciers?
In the instances referred to, the formation of new
matter at the root of the nail, and of new wood upon
the trunk and on the root of a tree, the pressure comes
from what is soft, and is applied effectually to what is
hard: so may it be with the action of the snow-field on
the glacier.</p>

<p>We left the Gries by the same mountain by which
we had reached it, with the difference that we now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
instead of traversing its southern, had to descend its
northern side. First, however, we had to ascend for
a few hundred yards. When you have reached the
highest point of the path, you look upon a large
expanse of the Bernese Oberland. You may find
among the Alps many views that are more extensive,
and many that in some one feature, or other, are more
striking than this. What, however, is before you from
this point is in a very high degree impressive. It is a
wondrous scene of Alpine architecture, simple in its
elements, but grand in its simplicity. To your left is
one of the exits of the Gries. The branch glacier in
it terminates abruptly, not after a gentle declivity,
such as that of the body of the glacier, but in the mid
descent of a precipitous outfall. The previously
smooth surface is here ruptured with many deep,
yawning, transverse seams. Beyond the glacier—to
you its further boundary—is a mountain so steep that
you may suppose, and perhaps rightly, that no human
foot could ascend it. This glacier gorge at your side
is a lateral of the transverse valley below you, a valley
of enormous depth, scantily clad with humble Alpine
pasturage. You can just make out the herd that is
grazing in it. On looking over the long steep-sided
mountain which forms its opposite range, at the foot
of which the cows are grazing, the south-eastern region
of the Bernese Oberland is spread out before you.
It is at that distance at which the field of vision may
comprise many objects, but every object is still seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
distinctly. In this wide, verdureless field, there is no
suggestion of life. The midday sun, which is shining
brightly upon it, brings out nothing but the gray of
the summits of rock, which, when not in the shade,
show of a pale ash colour, and the white of the summits
of snow, which gleams and dazzles in its purity. This
dark gray, pale ash, and gleamy white are the only
colouring. The gray and pale ash predominate in an
endless variety of forms—mountain walls, ridges,
battlements, bastions, and escarpments. Every here
and there above these is a dome, or a tower, or a
pinnacle of gleaming white, just as the domes, and
towers, and pinnacles of a great city rise above its
other buildings. This is a city of the world’s Builder
in which every building is an Alp.</p>

<p>You continue your descent, and soon lose this
grand view. But the mountain side, down which your
way lies, is grander than usual, longer, and steeper.
Your path takes you by intrusive dykes of gneiss and
of a black basaltic-looking rock. We here overtook
two professors, a botanist with his cases, and an entomologist
with his net. They had been beaten by the
ascent, and were retracing their steps, fagged, crestfallen,
and disappointed. They had our sympathy
for their pursuits, and our condolence for their disappointment.
Poor fellows! they had just made the
painful discovery—may it not have been made too
late—that in their mode of life there had been too
much desk work, and not enough field work. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
human physiology shall be better understood these sad
mistakes will not be so frequent. You have now got
down into the valley. You look up at the mountain
you have been descending. Its height, its steepness,
its mass, its ruggedness, its hardness, its inexorableness
are so overpowering that your eye shrinks from
the effort to aid you in constructing an image of it.
At the foot of that high, overhanging, cloud-cleaving
upheaval of adamant, you feel very small, very feeble;
to your present apprehension your bones are no more
than straws, if so much. For a time you allow these
impressions of the locality to run their course. Your
way is then along the deep valley. As you advance
down it you give more heed than usual to the hurrying
dashing stream, and you note with more observance
than usual the reappearance of the first trees, and of
the first <i>châlets</i>, and even the form and size of the
detached rocks, for the thought is in your mind that
these sounds and sights are being presented to you, for
this year at all events, now for the last time. And so
about midday you reach the little flat of Ulrichen,
and your Month is ended. Your walk will have taken
you over between 300 and 400 miles, comprising more
than a dozen Passes of one kind or another; and you
will have seen much of nature and of man to awaken
thought, and to interest you. Every day will have
been worth living, and not least so the last. But
whatever your capacity for being benefited, or
interested, by what you may have seen, you will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
but slightly, if at all, indebted for it to that eight-parts-of-speech
lore, the study of which, though it
formed the chief occupation of all the days of our
blessed youth, did not issue in enabling all of us to
know so much, or so little, as the names of those eight
parts of speech.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="NOTE">NOTE TO CHAPTER XIII.<br><span class="small"><i>SOME REMARKS ON THE HISTORY AND EFFECTS OF
OUR POOR LAW IN CONNEXION WITH PEASANT
PROPRIETORSHIP.</i></span></h2></div>


<p>I relegate this note to the end of the volume, because
its introduction into the body of the work would have been
too great an interruption of the continuity of the narrative.</p>

<p>A little comparative history may add to the interest of
the picture which the Prätigäu presents. In that valley, as
in many others in Switzerland, the peasants are ready to give
so high a price for an acre of land that large properties have
become impossible; that is to say, there cannot be, as the
general rule, any proprietors in localities so circumstanced
excepting peasants. In England, however, where an acre
of agricultural land does not sell for more than, or for as
much as, half of what an acre sells for in these valleys, there
are no peasant proprietors. Here, notwithstanding the cheapness
of land, it is the small properties that have become
impossible, and the general rule is that there can be none
but large proprietors. The difference is diametrical. Can
it in any way be accounted for?</p>

<p>The question suggested to us is, How has it come about
that, while the peasant proprietors have extinguished the
large proprietors in the Prätigäu, the large proprietors have
extinguished the peasant proprietors in England? As respects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
the case of the former there can be no difficulty in seeing
that, if the peasant cultivators will give more for land than
those who would buy for investment could afford to give,
then those who would buy for investment must disappear
from the market, and that already existing large properties
will gradually melt away under the action of this solvent.
As respects ourselves the answer usually given is that the
land in this country is too dear for peasant proprietors.
This supposition, however, as I have just noticed, is the
very reverse of the fact. In Switzerland, France, Belgium,
Holland, and in parts of Germany and of Italy peasant proprietors
give a great deal more for land than it would cost
them in England. It may, therefore, be true that in England
the cheapness of land has been one of the conditions that
has contributed to the formation of large estates; but it is
quite impossible to maintain that in this country the dearness
of agricultural land has extinguished the class of peasant
proprietors, because here the price of land, so far from being
an obstacle to the existence of the class, has presented, and
at this moment presents, quite exceptionally favourable conditions
for its maintenance and increase.</p>

<p>Can any other reason be alleged? In the Chapter to
which this note is appended I have pointed out that the
English agricultural labourer does not possess the knowledge
and the habits of thought and life, which are indispensable
in a peasant proprietor. They are indispensable in him,
because they it is that enable him to live as a peasant proprietor.
This, if it be true, must be a serious impediment
to the re-establishment of the class amongst us, but cannot
be regarded as the primary cause of its extinction, because
Englishmen were as capable as other people of this knowledge
and of these habits. What was really and primarily
in fault was not the decay of this knowledge and of these
habits, but that which engendered and brought about this
decay amongst us alone of all people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span></p>

<p>If, then, the cause is neither in the present price of land
here, nor in any inherent incapacity in Englishmen, that is
to say, if it be neither in the land, nor in the men, where
else can we look for it? There remains no other direction
in which we can look but law, and the interpretation of law.
In the Middle Ages we had the peasant class of those times
fully developed here. There were in this country, as was
perhaps the case everywhere then, variations in the possessions
and rights of the class, but still at that time peasant
proprietors pretty generally, if not quite universally, formed
the basis of the English village community. Why did they
cease to do so? I think the answer is that in this country,
from a combination of exceptional causes, legislation and
the interpretation of law and custom became adverse to the
maintenance of the class. The exceptional causes were,
first, the strength of the governing class (locally represented
by Lords of manors), which was a consequence of the
Norman conquest; and the great rise in the money value of
cheese, hides, and wool, especially the last, consequent on
the influx of silver from the New World during the sixteenth
century, while for the production of these articles the climate,
and for their export the easily traversed surface of the country,
nowhere far from the coast, and numerous excellent harbours
offered pre-eminent advantages. There was, therefore, both
a strong motive for the extinction of peasant properties, and
power sufficient for effecting it. Peasant properties, which
everywhere implied rights of appurtenant common pasturage,
made the formation of large runs for numerous flocks of
sheep, or for a large combination of cattle breeding with
arable culture, impossible. They were, therefore, apparently
in the interests of the community, gradually rendered valueless
to their owners, absorbed, and extinguished. This
process, though it commenced at an earlier date, was chiefly
carried out in the reign of Elizabeth. Events in this matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
only took the direction and course which might have been
expected.</p>

<p>But it is clear that if the right of the peasant to maintain
himself from the produce of a piece of land which he himself
cultivates for the support of his family is abrogated, he
must either cease to exist, and then the cultivation of the
land would be impossible, or he must be maintained in some
other way. For centuries wages, the alternative method,
were not universally, or even generally, sufficient for this
purpose. The operations of agriculture were not at that
time as continuous as they are now; the demand for any
amount of agricultural produce was not as unfailing as it is
now; and the farmer had not access to such stores of capital
as exist now. Under these circumstances the alternative
was insufficient. What then was to be done? How was
the existence of the peasant to be maintained? He could
not be allowed the hide of plough land and the common
pasturage rights of his forefathers, for these were obstacles
to the formation of sheep farms, and to large culture; nor
could wages be relied on continuously. The method hit
upon showed the inventiveness of the English mind quite as
much as any one of the many institutions and discoveries
for which the world is indebted to the inhabitants of this
island. It was to give to the dispossessed peasantry, who
were henceforth to become agricultural labourers, a claim
on the parishes, in which they resided and laboured, to the
amount requisite for the support of themselves and of their
families, when through failure of work or of wages, through
sickness or age, they became incapable of supporting themselves.</p>

<p>Three centuries ago this was the <i>rationale</i> of the English
poor law, and it is so at this day. It was a substitute for
peasant proprietorship, and it aided in utterly extinguishing
it. If a little bit of land is the only means of supporting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
the life of a family, the family will, however great the cost
in labour, support itself by this means. But if you make
wages, supplemented by a claim on the produce of the land,
an alternative means; and at the same time bring into play
causes which shall partly dispose, and partly drive, the
peasantry to accept this alternative; they will accept it, and
peasant proprietorship will cease. This I think is in a few
words the explanation of the unique fact that in this country
there is no class of peasant proprietors. Our legislation
favoured the consolidation and accumulation of large estates.
It did not favour the maintenance of peasant properties:
with respect to them its action and pressure were in the
opposite direction; while at the same time it gave the peasants
an alternative means of support. The tendency of events,
and the pressure of circumstances were irresistible; and the
whole class either became disposed, or was driven, to accept
the alternative; and so the class of peasant proprietors was
utterly extinguished. Had circumstances, legislation, and
the interpretation the law put on the rights of the class
favoured its maintenance in this country, we should have
had here a peasant class similar to that of Switzerland,
France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, and other countries. The
existence here of exceptional conditions had an exceptional
issue.</p>

<p>The extinction of the class has been followed by many
large and important consequences. Of these the most
obvious is the difference between the class that has been
introduced as the basis of our social system, that of agricultural
labourers, and the class that was extinguished, that of
peasant proprietors. No greater difference can exist between
men. Peasant proprietors in their industry, tenacity, and
stability have just the qualities which might have fitted them
for constituting an useful element in the foundation of so
artificial and ill-balanced a social fabric as that of England,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
for as to their narrowness of view, their chief defect of
character, that in so rich a community would have been of
little detriment in any way; and besides, too, in this country
we must compare what their narrowness would have been
with the far greater narrowness of our agricultural labourers.
On the other side agricultural labourers are a very poor
foundation for the social fabric, and most especially in a
commercial and manufacturing community, which already
from these sources has a dangerously numerous <i>prolétariat</i>.
As a class they are improvident, thriftless, shiftless, have no
sense of self-dependence, and not much of self-respect, their
self-acting effectual education having been that which results
from the teaching of wages, supplemented by a poor law.</p>

<p>The question of peasant proprietorship, as now discussed
among ourselves, is generally restricted to economical considerations.
It is asked, as if this contained the whole
question, whether the economical results of peasant culture
are as satisfactory, acre for acre, as those of large farms?
This, though an important part of the question, is not the
whole of it: perhaps it is not the chief part of it. The
character of the basis of our social fabric may be a matter
of more consequence to the nation than even the amount of
produce per acre. It will explain what is contained in this
remark, if I say that I suppose that everybody would think
that to admit to our parliamentary constituency a million
voters, whose sentiments and ideas were in the main those
of peasant proprietors, would be a less hazardous operation
than to admit a million pauperized agricultural labourers,
who, possibly, might endeavour to use the franchise for the
purpose of securing a more liberal administration of the poor
law. And, practically, there would be some justification for
such an attempt, if made by them, for the poor law may be
regarded historically as the compensation given to their
class for the extinction of commonable rights in the land,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
and, together with those commonable rights, of peasant properties;
for it is clear that if those common rights, and the
associated peasant properties, had been retained, there would
so far have been no occasion for a poor law.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the improvidence and misery of our
agricultural labourers have for many generations given us a
large supply of labour for building up our manufacturing and
commercial establishments, and for peopling the New World,
and our Australian and other colonies. The same cause
may also have enabled us to maintain our military force by
voluntary enlistment. But as the same amount of land in
the hands of peasant proprietors maintains four or five times
as large an agricultural population as it does when cultivated
by hired labourers, it is quite possible that we might have
received even a better supply from the alternative system.
At all events, now, in consequence of a largely increased
demand for men, contemporaneously with an actual decrease
of our relatively small agricultural population, which under
existing circumstances is our chief nursery for recruits for all
purposes, we are beginning to be pressed hard for men.
We are now suffering from a want of men, and would be
glad if there were some element in our agrarian system which
made that ingredient of our population far more considerable
than it now is. Another evil consequence, then, of a mistake
made three hundred years ago has begun to manifest
itself.</p>

<p>The price of labour is closely connected with its supply,
insomuch that it may be argued that if a system has hitherto
produced an abundant supply it must also have lowered its
cost. It is obvious, however, to remark that the value of
labour depends not so much on the amount of wages that
are paid, as on the amount and character of work that is
done. This is so much the case that it has come to be regarded
as a general rule that holds good all over the world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
that labour is least productive where wages are lowest; and
there have been some who have thought that this might have
been said in their proportion of our agricultural labourers.
As a matter of fact, however, wages have been higher in this
than in neighbouring countries. Nor, in estimating the cost
of our labour, would it be allowable to leave out of our calculation
the amount of our poor rate. That has for centuries
been raised for the purpose of supplementing wages, and so
is practically a part of the wages of the labouring class, levied
on the owners of land and houses. By the way, we often
hear this limitation of the incidence of the poor rate complained
of; but if our account of the <i>rationale</i> of the origin
and action of the poor law be correct, it may be questioned
whether the incidence of the rate ought not, in rural districts,
to have been restricted entirely to land, because the motive
of the law was to enable large estates to be formed, and to be
cultivated by a poorly paid class of labourers, who for many
generations were by the law tied to the land they cultivated.</p>

<p>Another consequence of the obliteration of the class of
peasant proprietors, which is well worthy of notice on account
of its wide and deep effects, is that it has prevented the price
of every acre of agricultural land in the country from rising
beyond half the sum it would now have reached had this
class continued to exist amongst us. In far poorer countries
than England peasants will gladly give for such land twice as
much as is its market price here. If we had this class here,
its members would do the same here. But, as this class has
been eliminated here, those, who in this country purchase
land as an investment for capital, have it all their own way.
The class who would bid twice as much for the land as the
capitalist now gets it for does not exist amongst us. The
consequence is that he buys his land cheap, very cheap
indeed. This will be seen, if what he gets for his money is
compared with what other people get for theirs when it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
put into consols. The latter get a little more than 3 per
cent. with some prospect of depreciation of the capital, and
with a certainty in these days of depreciation in the purchasing
power of the 3 per cent. interest. The capitalist,
however, who invests in land gets for the present a little less
than 3 per cent., but besides this immediate percentage he
gets the safest of all investments, plus the most improving
in the long run of all investments, plus the social and political
status the possession of land confers, plus several minor
advantages. Investors, therefore, in land in this country
have no reason to complain of the price they give for their
land, or of what they get for their money.</p>

<p>For this they are indebted to the extinction amongst us
of the class of peasant proprietors. Just as the people who
buy ships are the people who want ships for the business
they understand and are engaged in, and the people who
buy factories are those who want factories for the business
they understand and are engaged in, and those who buy
stock in trade of any kind are those who understand and
are engaged in the trade for which the stock they purchase
is necessary, so those who are most eager to buy land are
those who understand how to get a living out of the land by
the application to it of their own labour. They are the
class, who may be regarded as, <i>par excellence</i>, the natural
purchasers of land. This class, however, has in this country
been extinguished. The market, therefore, has been completely
cleared for those who would wish to purchase land
as an investment, and they, under the present condition of
things amongst us, are limited to those who are able to invest
largely, or who buy with the view of adding their purchases
to properties that are already large. They, therefore,
in buying land have it all their own way; and this is the
reason why they get their land at a price which yields an
immediate return of something less than 3 per cent., plus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
many other valuable considerations. If the peasant proprietor
class existed here to such an extent as to effectually
compete with them, they would have to give a price that
would not yield 1¹⁄₂ per cent. for agricultural land. They
do, then, get their land very cheap, which is a result, perhaps
one that was not originally foreseen, of the action during
three centuries of our poor law. The extinction of the class
of peasant proprietors has thus very effectively aided the
practice of settling and charging estates in bringing about
the large agglomerations of landed property, together with
all the resultant peculiarities, which distinguish our agrarian
system from that of any other country.</p>

<p>But if those who buy land get it at half its value, those
who sell it get for it only half of what they otherwise would.
This suggests the question whether it would be better for
the country that the value of the agricultural land of the
United Kingdom should be doubled? This may be answered
by the question whether it is not better for us to have land
at its present price of say 60<i>l.</i> an acre, than it would be to
have it at 30<i>l.</i>? If 60<i>l.</i> is better than 30<i>l.</i>, then I suppose

<p>The facts and considerations that have been now referred
to may throw some light on a question of which a great deal
has been heard lately—that of what is called tenant rights.
It may, of course, be asked whether the progress of time has
endowed tenants with any new rights? How can the tenants
of to-day have rights of which the tenants of yesterday had
no conception? Or, to speak broadly, can a tenant, as a
tenant, have any right except that of entering into a contract
with a landowner, and of invoking the law for the enforcement
of the provisions of his contract? But if it were
answered that time can give him no new rights, and that he
can have no rights but those for which he contracts, still
what is really meant by the question would not be settled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
By a process of legislation the land of the country having
been formed into estates of such dimensions that their
owners cannot possibly cultivate them, and small proprietors
having been extinguished, the tenants are now presented to
us as the only producers of food for the community. Under
these circumstances the question arises whether it would
not be for the advantage of the community that the position
of the tenants should be so improved as to lead to their
investing more money than they can at present with safety
in the cultivation of the soil, that is to say to their producing
a great deal more food for the community? This improvement
in the tenants’ position can be conceded only at the
cost of the existing legal rights of the landowners, and can
be refused only at the cost of the imprescriptible natural
rights of the community; for of such a character is the right
of the community to the greatest amount of food the soil of
the country can be made to yield. This is in a sense the
highest of all rights, for it is the right of a community to
existence. It was in the name, and for the sake, of this
right that under the conditions of past times the rights of
individual proprietorship, which were not primeval, were
first conceded. They had become necessary for the cultivation
of the soil, and, therefore, were allowed to be established
at the expense of the previously existing common
rights. In this view tenant rights are not rights which the
tenants can claim in law, but rights which it may be supposed
belong to the community, and the concession of which to
the tenants the community may demand for the general
advantage, it may be even for the general safety. The two
years’ notice which the present Premier is said to regard
with favour is precisely a concession of this kind. It is a
curtailment of the rights of the landowners, to which the
tenants can have no legal, or rightful, claim: it is, however,
a concession which, presumably, would promote the advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
of the public, and which, therefore, public policy may
require. If improvements of this kind in the position of the
tenants would increase the produce of the country by one
half, then that addition of a half to the produce of the
country is exactly the weight of the argument in favour of
the concession of tenant rights so called: to endow the
tenants with these rights would add, every year, one hundred
million pounds’ worth of food to the produce of this country,
that is to say to the subsistence of the community.</p>

<p>This list of the consequences of the working for three
centuries of our English poor law might be greatly increased;
for instance, the division of the people it has helped to bring
about into a comparatively small class who are very rich and
a very large class who have not, and never can have, any
real property, accounts for the elsewhere unheard of demands
that are made on the charity of the small class, and which
demands are complied with because of their obvious necessity.
Again also the great bulk of the agricultural land of
the kingdom being held in large estates—a result in part of
the working of the same law—the owners of these large
estates can afford to spend no inconsiderable part of the
rent of the whole kingdom in London, which to a very
appreciable extent accounts for the vastness of London.
The poorness, and almost meanness of life in our provincial
towns are also to be accounted for by a reference to the
same fact. The rent of the land around these towns is not
spent in them, but in London or elsewhere: at all events
the adjacent landowners rarely live in, or contribute anything
towards the embellishment of the life of, these towns.
Enough, however, has been said to show that the endowment
and establishment of pauperism, as an integral part of
the British constitution, as much so as the Crown, or the
Peerage, has had very extensive effects. It could not have
been otherwise, for it was the elimination from the constitution
of society, as far as the mass of the people were concerned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
of the old elements of self-dependence and property,
and the substitution in their place of dependence and of
public doles. These were new conditions to which all the
arrangements of society in their endless ramifications had to
accommodate and adjust themselves, and to which the future
progress of society had to conform.</p>

<p>The course of events, then, taking the words in their
widest sense, is what has given to the Prätigäu its ten thousand
peasant proprietors, and it is what has extinguished the
class amongst ourselves. If the course of events affecting
each of us had been interchanged their condition might have
been witnessed in this country, and our condition might have
been theirs. Whether it be possible in these days, in the
face of emigration, of high wages, of settled estates, of the
demoralization of the agricultural labourer, and of a poor
law, to recover the lost class may well be doubted. But
however that may be, it cannot be good policy to maintain
any artificial, that is to say any legislative, obstacles in the
way of the reappearance amongst us of the class, if that be
possible, any more than it can be to maintain any arrangements
that might be having the effect of hindering capital
from being employed on the largest scale, and to the greatest
profitable amount per acre, in increasing the produce of the
soil. Food-factories, of at least 1,000 acres each, appear to
be a natural result of the combination of capital and science
now possible. Let us, therefore, have a clear stage for these.
That, however, is no reason why we should not at the same
time have a clear stage for peasant proprietors also. Let
nothing be done with the view of favouring and nursing
either one or the other, but at the same time let nothing be
maintained that is a hindrance to the existence of either.
There appears to be no ground for supposing that our present
land-system favours either; it may not, however, be
equally beyond controversy that it is not a hindrance to
both.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
